<h2>TO THE<br /><span class="xx-large">READER.</span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">SOME of the Principal Discoveries and Enquiries, both
in <i>Physical</i> and <i>Mathematical</i> Learning, being register'd in
the Voluminous Journals of the <i>Royal Society</i>, are amongst a
multitude of less useful Matters, so Obscurely hid, that but very few
inquisitive Gentlemen ever so much as heard of them.</p>

<p>The Design therefore of the ensuing Collection, is to digest in a
convenient Method, all the most curious <i>Philosophical</i> and
<i>Mathematical</i> Discoveries, as they are to be met with, which may
any way tend to the Use of Life or Advancement of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>And on this Occasion, it will be convenient to intimate to the Reader;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That the Theories and Discourses here collected, have
already past the Censure of the <i>Learned World</i>: Who have
acknowleg'd them the most satisfactory Accounts of Nature's Proceedings,
wherein some of her greatest Depths are fathom'd, and a Foundation laid
for Posterity to build an infinite <i>Superstructure</i>.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That they are related (<i>Verbatim</i>) just as they
were delivered in, or read before the <i>Royal Society</i>: For it has
been the Opinion of the most Judicious among those <i>Honourable
Members</i>, that it is impossible so to abridge them, (which are but
Abridgments themselves) as not to render them obscure and unintelligible.</p>

<h3>A Translation of Part of Monsieur <strong>Fontenelle's</strong>
Preface to the Memoirs of the Royal Academy at <strong>Paris</strong>,
in the Year 1699. treating of the Usefulness of Mathematical
Learning.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">BUT to what purpose should People become fond of the
Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy. Of what use are the Transactions of
the Academy? These are common Questions, which most do not barely
propose as Questions; and it will not be improper to clear them.</p>

<p>People very readily call useless, what they do not understand. It is
a sort of Revenge; and as the Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy are
known but by few, they are generally look'd upon as useless. The reason
of this is; because they are crabbed and not easily learnt.</p>

<p>We have a Moon to light us in the Night; What is it to us, say they,
whether <i>Jupiter</i> hath four? Why so many laborious Observations, so
many tedious Calculations to know exactly their Course? They'll not
afford us the more Light for it; and Nature, which hath plac'd these
little Planets without the reach of our Eyes, doth not seem to have made
them for us. According to this plausible Argument they ought not to have
been observ'd with a Telescope, nor study'd. But it is certain, that we
had been considerable Loosers by it: For those who have some insight
into the Principles of Geography and Navigation know, that since these
four Moons about <i>Jupiter</i> have been discover'd, they have been
more useful to those Sciences than our own Moon; and that they serve,
and shall more and more serve to make new Sea-Charts, infinitely more
exact than the Old; and are likely to save the Lives of a vast many
Seamen. Did we reap no other advantage from Astronomy than this from
these Satellites of <i>Jupiter</i>, that wou'd be sufficient to justifie
those prodigious Calculations, those assiduous and nice Observations,
this great number of elaborate Instruments, and this Noble Edifice built
only for this Science. However the greatest part of Mankind know nothing
of these Satellites of <i>Jupiter</i>, unless perhaps by hear-say, and
that too confusedly; or else they are ignorant of what Affinity they
have with Navigation, or of the great Improvements which have been
lately made in it.</p>

<p>This is the Fate of Sciences, which are study'd and improv'd by few.
Most People are not sensible of their Progress, and especially when made
in some mean Callings. But what doth it signifie, that we can now more
easily direct the Course of Rivers, cut out Canals, and settle new
Navigations; because our Method of taking the Level and making Sluces is
infinitely better than heretofore? Some Masons and Seamen have thereby
found their Business easier, but they themselves were not sensible of
the Skill of the Geometrician who directed them. They were mov'd, as the
Body by a Soul, it doth not know. Others are yet less sensible of the
Genius that presided over the Undertaking; and the World is the better
for its succeeding well, but not altogether free from Ingratitude.</p>

<p>Anatomy, which is some time since so carefully study'd, can't become
more exact, but Chyrurgical Operations must also be more sure. Surgeons
know this; but those who receive the Benefit of their Art know nothing
of it. And indeed how should they? They would be oblig'd to compare Old
with Modern Surgery; and this wou'd take too much Time, and go against
the Grain: So that since the Operation hath succeeded well, they do not
think it material to know whether it had succeeded as well in another
Century.</p>

<p>It is strange that so many things are before our Eyes, and that we do
not see them. Your Handycraft Shops are full of ingenious Works; but yet
we hardly mind them: And very useful and well contriv'd Instruments and
Experiments want Spectators, who wou'd be wonderfully pleas'd, wou'd
they take the pains to admire them.</p>

<p>If a Learned Society have made some Improvements in Geometry,
Anatomy, Mechanicks, or any other useful Science, it must not be
expected, that the World will go back to so remote a Spring to thank and
applaud them for the Usefulness of their Productions: For it will be
more easie to enjoy the Benefit of their Discoveries and Improvements
than to know them. The Determination of Longitude by the Satellites, the
Discovery of the <i>Ductus Thoracicus</i>, a more convenient, and more
exact Level, are not Novelties so fit to make a noise as a pleasant
Poem, or a handsome Piece of Oratory.</p>

<p>Altho' the Usefulness of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy is
obscure, yet it is real. To consider Mankind in their Natural State,
nothing is more useful to them, than what may preserve their Lives, and
produce those Arts, which are both great Helps and Ornaments to Publick
Societies.</p>

<p>As for what concerns the Preservation of Life, it peculiarly belongs
to Physick; which for that reason is divided in the Academy into three
Branches, which make three different sorts of Members of this Society,
Anatomy, Chymistry, and Botanicks. Every Body knows of what Importance
it is to have an exact Knowledge of Human Body, and of what Medicines
may be extracted from Minerals and Plants.</p>

<p>As for Arts, too tedious to be reckon'd, they depend some upon
Natural Philosophy, others upon Mathematicks.</p>

<p>One wou'd think at first, that if the Mathematicks were to be
confin'd to what is useful in them, they ought only to be improv'd in
those things, which have an immediate and sensible affinity with Arts,
and the rest ought to be neglected as a Vain Theory. But this wou'd be a
very wrong Notion. As for Instance, the Art of Navigation hath a
necessary Connexion with Astronomy, and Astronomy can never be too much
improv'd for the Benefit of Navigation. Astronomy cannot be without
Opticks by reason of Perspective Glasses; and both, as all other Parts
of Mathematicks, are grounded upon Geometry, and to go as far as you
can, even upon Algebra.</p>

<p>Geometry, and especially Algebra, are the Keys of all the Inquiries,
that can be made concerning Magnitude. These Sciences which are only
conversant about abstruse Relations, and simple Ideas, may seem dry and
barren, whilst they keep within the Verge of the Intellectual World; but
mixt Mathematicks, which stoop to Matter, and consider the Motion of the
Stars, the Augmentation of moving Forces, the different Passages of the
Rays of Light through different Mediums; the different Effects of Sound
by the Vibration of Things; to conclude all those Sciences, which
discover the particular Relations of Sensible Magnitudes go on farther
and more securely, when the Art of discovering Relations in General is
more perfect. The Universal Instrument cannot be too extensive, too
handy, or too easily apply'd: It is useful to all the Sciences, and they
cannot be without it: And therefore among the Mathematicians of the
Academy, who are design'd to be useful to the Publick, the Geometricians
and Algebrists make a Class, as well as the Astronomers and
Mechanicks.</p>

<p>However, it is certain, that Speculations purely of Geometry, or of
Algebra, are not about useful things: But it is certain too, that those
that are not, either lead or belong to those that are. It is in it self
a very barren thing to know, that in a Parabola a Subtangant is double
the corresponding Abscissæ; but yet it is a Degree of Knowledge
necessary to the Art of throwing Bombs, so exactly as they can do now.
There are not by far so many evident Uses as Propositions or Truths in
the Mathematicks: Yet it is enough if the Concourse of several Truths is
generally of some use.</p>

<p>Farther, a Geometrical Speculation, which was not at first applicable
to any use, becomes so afterwards. When the greatest Geometricians in
the Seventeenth Century set about to study a new Curve, which they
call'd a Cycloide, they only engag'd themselves in a meer Speculation
out of Vanity, striving to outdo one another by the Discovery of
difficult Theorems. They did not even pretend that this was for the
Publick Good; however by diving into the Nature of the Cycloide it was
found, that it was destin'd to make Pendulums as perfect as may be, and
carry the Measure of Time as far as it can go.</p>

<p>It is the same thing with Natural Philosophy as with Geometry. The
Anatomy of Animals seems insignificant; and it only concerns us to know
that of Human Body. But yet some Parts of it, which are of so nice, or
so confus'd a Make, that they are invisible, are sensible and manifest
in the Body of an Animal. Hence it is, that Monsters themselves are not
to be neglected. The Mechanism conceal'd in a particular Kind or in a
common Make, is unfolded in another kind, or in an extraordinary Make;
and one wou'd be almost apt to say, that Nature by multiplying and
varying so much her Works, can't sometimes forbear betraying her
Secrets. All that the Antients knew of the Load-stone, was, that it
attracts Iron. But whether they did not value a Curiosity, which
promis'd them nothing; or that their Genius did not lead them to make
Experiments, they have not examin'd this Stone as carefully as they
might. One Experiment taught them, that it turns of its self towards the
Poles of the World, and did put into their Hands the inestimable
Treasure of the Mariners Compass. They might easily have made this
Discovery important, and yet they did not do it; and if they had spent a
little more time upon a Curiosity which seem'd useless to them, the
Latent use of it had soon appear'd.</p>

<p>Let us always make a Collection of Mathematical and Physical Truths;
happen what it will we can't hazard much by it. It is certain, that they
shall be drawn from Springs, whence a great many useful ones have
already been drawn. We have reason to presume, that we shall draw from
thence, some that shall shine as soon as they are discover'd, and
convince us of their Usefulness. Other Truths shall stay some time till
a piercing Meditation, or some happy Accident discovers their Use. Some
Truths being consider'd by themselves shall be barren, till they are
consider'd with reference to one another. Lastly, let the worse come to
the worse, some shall be eternally useless.</p>

<p>I mean useless with reference to sensible and gross Uses; for
otherwise they shall not be so. An Object upon which alone you cast your
Eyes is the clearer and brighter, when the neighbouring Objects, which
however you do not look upon, are also enlighten'd; because it hath the
Benefit of the Rays, which are reflected from them. Thus those
Discoveries, which are palpably useful, and deserve our chiefest
Attention, are in some measure enlighten'd by those, which may be call'd
useless. For all Truths make one another more lucid.</p>

<p>It is always useful to have right Notions, even of useless Subjects.
And tho' we cou'd reap no benefit by the Knowledge of Numbers and Sines,
yet it wou'd still be the only certain Knowledge granted to our Natural
Light, and they wou'd serve to give our Reason the first Habit of and
Inclination to Truth. They wou'd teach us to operate upon Truths; to
take the Thread of them, which is generally very fine and almost
imperceptible; and to follow it as far as it reaches: In a word, they
wou'd make Truth so familiar, that we might on other Occasions know it
at first sight, and almost by Instinct.</p>

<p>A Geometrical Genius is not so confin'd to Geometry, but that it may
be capable of learning other Sciences. A Tract of Morality, Politicks,
or Criticism, and even a Piece of Oratory, supposing the Author
qualify'd otherwise for those Performances, shall be the better for
being compos'd by a Geometrician. That Order, Perspicuity,
<i>Precision</i> and Exactness, which some time since are found in good
Books, may originally proceed from that Geometrical Genius, which is now
more common than ever, and in some manner is communicated by one
Relation to another, nay even to those that do not understand Geometry.
Sometimes a Great Man draws all his Cotemporaries after him; and he who
hath the justest Claim to the Glory of having settled a new Art of
Arguing, was an Excellent Geometrician.</p>

<p>Lastly, whatever raises us to Great and Noble Reflexions, tho' they
be purely Speculative, afford a Spiritual and Philosophical
<i>Utility</i>. The Wants of the Mind are perhaps as many as those of
the Body. She desires to extend her Knowledge: All that can be known, is
necessary to her, and there can be no better Proof than this, that she
is design'd for Truth. Nothing perhaps can redound more to her Glory,
than the Pleasure that is felt sometimes, in spight of ones self, in the
dry and crabbed Questions of Algebra.</p>

<p>But without running counter to the common Notions, and recurring to
Advantages which may seem too far fetch'd and refin'd, it may fairly be
own'd, that the Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy have some things
which are only subservient to Curiosity; and so have those Sciences
which are most generally acknowledg'd to be useful, as History,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>History doth not in every Part of it supply us with Examples of
Vertue and Rules for our Behaviour. For besides these, therein you have
a View of the perpetual Revolutions of Human Affairs, of the Beginning
and Fall of Empires, of Manners, Customs, and Opinions which continually
succeed one another; and in a word, of all that rapid, tho' insensible,
Motion that carries all before it, and incessantly alters the Face of
the Earth.</p>

<p>Had we a mind to oppose Curiosity to Curiosity, we shou'd find that
instead of the Motion, which agitates Nations, and gives birth to, and
destroys States; Natural Philosophy considers that Great and Universal
Motion, which hath put the whole Frame of Nature in Order, and suspended
the Cœlestial Bodies in several Spheres, and which illuminates and
extinguishes some Stars; and by following always unalterable Laws,
diversifies its effects <i>ad infinitum</i>. If the surprising
difference of Manners and Opinions of Mankind is so entertaining; there
is too a great deal of Pleasure to study the prodigious diversity of the
Structure of the different Species of Animals, with reference to their
different Functions, to the Elements they live in, to the Climates they
inhabit, and the Aliments they are to take, <i>&amp;c.</i> The most curious
strokes of History shall hardly be more curious than the
<i>Phosphorus</i>, the cold Liquors which being mixt together, break out
into a flame; Silver Trees, the almost Magical Operations of the
Load-Stone, and a vast number of Secrets, which Art hath discover'd by a
near and diligent Scrutiny of Nature.</p>

<p>Lastly, Natural Philosophy doth as much as it is possible unravel the
Footsteps of that Infinite Intellect and Wisdom, who hath made all
things: Whereas the Object of History are the disorderly Effects of the
Passion, and of Humane Caprices; and so odd a Series of Events, that
some formerly fancy'd that a Blind and Senseless Deity had the Direction
of them.</p>

<p>We must not look upon the Sublime Reflexions which Natural Philosophy
leads us to make concerning the Author of the Universe, as meer
Curiosities. For this stupendous Work, which appears always more
wonderful the more we know it, gives us such exalted Notions of its
Maker, that they fill our Minds with Admiration and Respect. But above
all, Astronomy and Anatomy are the two Sciences which more palpably lay
before us two grand Attributes of our Creator; one his Immensity by the
distance, Magnitude and Number of Cœlestial Bodies; the other his
Infinite Knowledge by the Mechanism of Animals. True Natural Philosophy
is a kind of Theology.</p>

<p>The different views of Humane Understanding are almost infinite; and
Nature is really so. So that we may every day expect some Discoveries,
either in Mathematicks or Natural Philosophy, which shall be of a new
sort of Utility or Curiosity. Make a Collection of all the different
Advantages which the Mathematicks afforded a Hundred Years ago, and
you'll find nothing to be compar'd to the Perspective Glasses they have
furnish'd since that time, and which are a new Organ to the Sight, and
cou'd not be expected from Art. How surpriz'd had the Ancients been, if
they had been told that their Posterity, by the help of some
Instruments, shou'd one day see a vast number of Objects which they did
not see; a Heaven that was unknown to them; and Plants and Animals they
did not even suspect it was possible to exist. Naturalists had already a
great many curious Experiments; but within about half a Century, the
Air-Pump hath produced a prodigious quantity of them wholly new, and
which by shewing Bodies in a Space void of Air, shews them as
transported in a World different from ours, where they undergo
Alterations whereof we had no Notion. The Excellency of Geometrical
Methods, which are every day invented and improv'd, may perhaps at last
exhaust Geometry; that is, The Art of making Geometrical Discoveries,
and that is all: Whereas Natural Philosophy, which contemplates an
Object of an unlimited Variety, and <i>Fæcundity</i>, shall always find
room for new Observations, and opportunities to increase its vast Stock,
and shall have the Advantage of never being a compleat Science.</p>

<p>There are so many things to be discover'd, whereof a great part, in
all likelyhood shall never be known; that they give an opportunity to
those who will not encounter with the Thorns and Difficulties of Natural
Philosophy, to affect a sort of Discouragement. A great many to vilify
this Natural Science, pretend a mighty veneration for the works of
Nature, and that they are absolutely incomprehensible. However, Nature
is never so admirable, nor so admir'd as when known. True it is, that
what is known is inconsiderable in comparison of what is not yet known.
Nay, Sometimes what is not known, is exactly what seems shou'd be the
soonest known. As for instance, it is not at least certainly known, why
a Stone thrown up into the Air falls down again; but we certainly know
the cause of the Rainbow, why it doth not exceed a certain height; why
its breadth is always the same; why when there are two Rainbows at the
same time, the Colours of the one are overset with reference to the
Colours of the other; and yet the fall of a Stone in the Air appears a
more simple Phænomenon, than the Rainbow. But in a word, altho' we do
not know every thing, we are not neither ignorant of every thing. And
altho' we are ignorant of the most simple Events, yet we have a
knowledge of what seems the most Complex. So that if we have on the one
hand reason to fear, lest our Vanity shou'd flatter us with the hopes of
attaining to the knowledge of things above our reach; on the other we
ought to dread, lest our Slothfulness should also flatter us that we are
condemn'd to a greater degree of Ignorance than really we are.</p>

<p>People may think that the Sciences do not begin to exert themselves,
either because they cou'd be but imperfect among the Ancients; or
because we have almost lost the Footsteps of them during the gloomy
Darkness of Barbarity; or because a better method hath been taken about
100 Years ago. Was the Progress Historically examin'd, they have already
made in so short a time, notwithstanding the strong, but false
Prejudices they had long to encounter with, even sometimes the foreign
Obstacles they have met with from Authority and Power; the want of Zeal
for Sciences so remote from common use, those few who apply'd themselves
to this Work, and the weak Motives which engag'd them in it; a Man would
wonder at the Greatness and Rapidity of the Progress of the Sciences,
and even we might observe some new ones to start out of nothing, and
perhaps be tempted to have too great hopes of future Improvements.</p>

<p>The greater reason we have of future Success, the greater we have to
look upon the Sciences as in their Cradles, at least Natural Philosophy.
And therefore the Academy is only now employ'd to make an ample
Provision of Observations, and Facts well attested, which may one day be
the foundation of a System. For before the Systematical Natural
Philosophy can raise solid Edifices; Experimental Natural Philosophy
must be in a condition to supply it with good Materials.</p>

<p>None but Societies, of those too countenanc'd and encourag'd by the
Prince, can successfully make and prepare this Collection of Materials.
All the Learning, Care, Life and Wealth of one Private Man can never
answer this Design. There are too many different Experiments to be made,
which are to be too much vary'd, and a long time prosecuted with the
same Temper and Mind. The Cause of the least Effect is so wrap'd up,
that unless you very carefully open all the various Foldings, you cannot
come at it.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Academy of Sciences hath consider'd Nature but by
parcels: They have fix'd upon no general System, for fear of falling
into the inconveniency of hasty Systems, which are very grateful to the
impatience of Humane Understanding; and being once settled, are
Obstacles to what Truths are afterwards discover'd. This day we are sure
of a Fact, to morrow we shall be sure of another that hath no relation
with the former. However some Conjectures are ventur'd at upon Causes;
but they are only Conjectures. So that this Collection, which the
Academy gives to the Publick, is compos'd of separate Fragments,
independant of one another; whereof every one who is the Author,
warrants the Facts and Experiments; and whose Arguments are approv'd by
the Academy, but with Restrictions becoming Wise and Wary Scepticks.</p>

<p>Time perhaps will come, when these scatter'd Fragments shall be
united into one regular Body; and if they be such as they are wish'd,
they may of themselves Unite. A great many Truths, when their Numbers is
considerable, shew so near a Relation to, and so mutual a Dependance
upon one another, that it seems, that notwithstanding their violent
Separation, they have a natural Tendency to be re-united.</p>

<h3>An Estimate of the Quantity of the Vapours raised out of the Sea
derived from Experiment: Together with an Account of the Circulation of
the watry Vapours of the Sea, and of the Cause of Springs, presented to
the Royal Society. By Mr. <strong>E. Halley, F. R. S.</strong></h3>

<p class="dropcap">THAT the Quantity of Aqueous Vapours contain'd in the Medium of the
Air, is very considerable, seems most evident from the great Rains and
Snows which are sometimes observ'd to fall, to that degree, that the
Water thus discharg'd out of the Interstices of the Particles of Air, is
in weight a very sensible part of the incumbent Atmosphere: But in what
proportion these Vapours rise, which are the Sources not only of Rains,
but also of Springs or Fountains (as I design to prove) has not, that I
know of, been any where well examin'd, tho' it seem to be one of the
most necessary Ingredients of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
Real and Philosophical Meteorology, and, as such; to deserve the
Consideration of this Honourable Society. I thought it might not be
unacceptable to attempt by Experiment to determine the Quantity of the
Evaporations of Water, as far as they arise from Heat, which upon Trial
succeeded as follows.</p>

<p>We took a Pan of Water, about 4 inches deep, and 7 Inches
<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> Diameter, in which we placed a
Thermometer, and by means of a Pan of Coals, we brought the Water to the
same degree of Heat, which is observed to be that of the Air in our
hottest Summer; the Thermometer nicely shewing it: This done, we affixed
the Pan of Water, with the Thermometer in it, to one end of the Beam of
a Pair of Scales, and exactly counterpois'd it with weights in the other
Scale; and by the application or removal of the Pan of Coals, we found
it very easie to maintain the Water in the same degree of Heat
precisely. Doing thus we found the weight of the Water sensibly to
decrease; and at the end of two hours we observed that there wanted half
an Ounce <i>Troy</i>, all but 7 grains, or 233 grains of Water, which in
that time had gone off in Vapour; tho' one could hardly perceive it
smoke, and the Water were not sensibly warm. This Quantity in so short a
time seem'd very considerable, being little less than 6 ounces in 24
hours, from so small a Surface as a Circle of 8 inches Diameter. To
reduce this Experiment to an exact Calculus, and determine the thickness
of the Skin of Water that had so evaporated, I assume the Experiment
alledg'd by Dr. <i>Edward Bernard</i> to have been made in the
<i>Oxford</i> Society, <i>viz.</i> That the Cube-foot <i>English</i> of
Water weighs exactly 76
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
Pounds <i>Troy</i>; this divided by 1728, the number of Inches in a
Foot, will give 253⅓ grains, or ½ ounce 13⅓ grains for the weight of a
Cube-inch of Water; wherefore the weight of 233 grains is
<sup>233</sup>&frasl;<sub>253</sub> or 35 Parts of 38 of a Cube-inch of
Water. Now the Area of the Circle whose Diameter is
7<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> Inches, is 49 square Inches: by which
dividing the Quantity of Water evaporated, <i>viz.</i>
<sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>38</sub> of an Inch, the Quote
<sup>35</sup>&frasl;<sub>1862</sub> or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>53</sub>
shews that the thickness of the Water evaporated was the 53d part of an
Inch; but we will suppose it only the 60th part, for the Facility of
Calculation. If therefore Water as warm as the Air in Summer, exhales
the thickness of a 60th part of an Inch in two hours from its whole
Surface, in 12 hours it will exhale the ⅒ of an Inch; which Quantity
will be found abundantly sufficient to serve for all the Rains, Springs,
and Dews; and account for the <i>Caspian</i> Sea, being always at a
stand, neither wasting nor overflowing; as likewise for the Current said
to set always in at the Streights of <i>Gibralter</i>, tho' those
Mediterranean Seas receive so many and so considerable Rivers.</p>

<p>To estimate the Quantity of Water arising in Vapours out of the Sea,
I think I ought to consider it only for the time the Sun is up, for that
the Dews return in the Night, as much if not more Vapours than are then
emitted; and in Summer the Days being no longer than 12 hours, this
Excess is ballanc'd by the weaker Action of the Sun, especially when
rising before the Water be warmed: So that if I allow ⅒ of an Inch of
the Surface of the Sea, to be raised <i>per diem</i> in Vapours, it may
not be an improbable Conjecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
Upon this Supposition, every 10 square Inches of the Surface of the
Water, yields in Vapour <i>per diem</i> a Cube-inch of Water; and each
square Foot half a Wine-pint; every Space of 4 Foot square, a Gallon; a
Mile square, 6914 Tons; a square Degree suppose of 69 <i>English</i>
Miles, will evaporate 33 Millions of Tons: And if the Mediterranean be
estimated at forty degrees long and four broad, allowances being made
for the Places where it is broader, by those where it is narrower (and I
am sure I guess at the least) there will be 160 Square degrees of Sea;
and consequently, the whole Mediterranean must lose in Vapour, in a
Summer's day, at least 5280 Millions of Tons. And this Quantity of
Vapour, tho' very great, is as little as can be concluded from the
Experiment produced: And yet there remains another Cause, which cannot
be reduced to Rule, I mean the Winds, whereby the Surface of the Water
is licked up some times faster than it exhales by the heat of the Sun;
as is well known to those that have consider'd those drying Winds which
blow sometimes.</p>

<p>To estimate the Quantity of Water, the Mediterranean Sea receives
from the Rivers that fall into it, is a very hard Task, unless one had
the Opportunity to measure their Chanels and Velocity; and therefore we
can only do it by allowing more than enough; that is, by assuming these
Rivers greater than in all probability they be, and then comparing the
Quantity of Water voided by the <i>Thames</i>, with that of those
Rivers, whose Waters we desire to compute.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean receives these considerable Rivers; the
<i>Iberus</i>, the <i>Rhone</i>, the <i>Tiber</i>, the <i>Po</i>, the
<i>Danube</i>, the <i>Neister</i>, the <i>Borystenes</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
the <i>Tanais</i>, and the <i>Nile</i>; all the rest being of no great
Note, and their Quantity of Water inconsiderable: These nine Rivers, we
will suppose each of them to bring down ten times as much Water as the
River <i>Thames</i>; not that any of them is great in reality, but to
comprehend with them all the small Rivulets that fall into the Sea,
which otherwise I know not how to allow for.</p>

<p>To calculate the Water of the <i>Thames</i>, I assume that at
<i>Kingston</i> Bridge where the Flood never reaches, and the Water
always runs down, the breadth of the Chanel is 100 Yards, and its Depth
3, it being reduced to an Equality (in both which Suppositions I am sure
I take with the most) hence the Profil of the Water in this Place is 300
square Yards: This multiplied by 48 Miles (which I allow the Water to
run in 24 hours, at 2 Miles an hour) or 84480 Yards, gives 25344000
Cubick-yards of Water to be evacuated every Day; that is, 20300000 Tons
<i>per diem</i>; and I doubt not, but in the excess of my Measures of
the Chanel of the River, I have made more than sufficient allowance for
the Waters of the <i>Brent</i>, the <i>Wandel</i>, the <i>Lea</i>, and
<i>Darwent</i>, which are all worth notice, that fall into the
<i>Thames</i> below <i>Kingston</i>.</p>

<p>Now if each of the aforesaid 9 Rivers yield 10 times as much Water as
the <i>Thames</i> doth, 'twill follow that each of them yields but 203
Millions of Ton <i>per diem</i>, and the whole 9, but 1827 Millions of
Tons in a day; which is but little more than ⅓ of what is proved to be
raised in vapour out of the Mediterranean in 12 hours time. Now what
becomes of this Vapour when rais'd, and how it comes to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
that the Current always sets in at the Mouth, of the Streights of
<i>Gibralter</i>, shall immediately be shew'd: But first it is necessary
to advertise the Reader, that in making the Experiment herein mention'd,
the Water used had been salted to the same degree as is the common
Sea-water, by the Solution of about a 40th part of Salt.</p>

<p class="gap-above dropcap">HAving thus shew'd by Experiment the Quantity of
Water raised in Vapour from the Surface of the Sea in a Days time, which
was so far approv'd of by some Honourable Members of this Society, that
I receiv'd their Commands to prosecute these Enquiries; and
particularly, in relation to the Method used by Nature, to return the
said Vapours again into the Sea; which is so justly perform'd, that in
many hundred of Years we are sufficiently assured that the Sea has not
sensibly decreased by the loss in Vapour; nor yet abounded by the
immense Quantity of fresh it receives continually from the Rivers. To
demonstrate this Equilibre of Receipt and Expence in the whole Sea, is a
Task too hard for me to undertake, yet in obedience to those whom I have
the Honour to serve, I shall here offer, what to me has hitherto seem'd
the most satisfactory Account of this grand <i>Phænomenon</i>: I have in
another place attempted to explain the manner of the rising of Vapour by
Warmth, by shewing, that if an Atom of Water were expanded into a Shell
or Bubble, so as to be ten times as big in Diameter as when it was
Water; such an Atom would become specifically lighter than Air, and rise
so long as that <i>Flatus</i> or warm Spirit that first separated it
from the Mass of Water, shall continue to distend it to the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
Degree; and that Warmth declining, and the Air growing cooler and also
specifically lighter, the Vapours consequently shall stop at a certain
Region of the Air, or else descend, which may happen upon several
accounts, as I shall by and by endeavour to make out; yet I undertake
not that this is the only principal of the rise of Vapours, and that
there may not be a certain sort of Matter, whose <i>Conatus</i> may be
contrary to that of Gravity; as is evident in Vegetation, where in the
Tendency of the Sprouts is directly upwards, or against the
Perpendicular. But what ever is the true Cause, it is in Fact certain,
that warmth does separate the Particles of Water, and emit them with a
greater and greater Velocity, as the heat is more and more intense; as
is evident in the Steam of a boiling Cauldron, wherein likewise the
Velocity of the ascent of the Vapours does visibly decrease till they
disappear, being dispersed into and assimulated with the Ambient Air.
Vapours being thus raised by warmth, let us for a first Supposition put,
that the whole Surface of the Globe were all Water very deep, or rather
that the whole Body of the Earth were Water, and that the Sun had its
diurnal course about it: I take it, that it would follow, that the Air
of it self would imbibe a certain Quantity of aqueous Vapours, and
retain them like Salts dissolved in Water; that the Sun warming the Air,
and raising a more plentiful Vapour from the Water in the day-time, the
Air would sustain a greater proportion of Vapour, as warm Water will
hold more dissolved Salts, which upon the absence of the Sun in the
Nights would be all again discharged in Dews, analogous to the
Precipitation of Salts on the cooling of the Liquors; nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
is it to be believed that in such Case there would be any diversity of
Weather, other than periodically, every Year alike; the mixture of all
terrestrious, saline, heterogenious Vapours being taken away, which as
they are variously compounded and brought by the Winds, seem to be the
Causes of those various Seasons which we now find. In this case the
Aiery Regions every where, at the same height, would be equally
replenished with the Proportion of Water it could contain, regard being
only to be had to the different degree of warmth, from the nearness or
distance of the Sun; and an eternal East-wind would blow all round the
Globe, inclining only to the same side of the <i>East</i>, as the
Latitude doth from the Equator; as is observed in the Ocean between the
Tropicks.</p>

<p>Next let us suppose this Ocean interspersed with wide and spacious
Tracts of Land, with high Ridges of Mountains, such as the
<i>Pyrenean</i>, the <i>Alps</i>, the <i>Apennine</i>, the
<i>Carpathian</i> in <i>Europe</i>, <i>Taurus</i>, <i>Caucasus</i>,
<i>Imaus</i>, and several others in <i>Asia</i>; <i>Atlas</i> and the
<i>Montes Lunæ</i>, with other unknown Ridges in <i>Africa</i>, whence
came the <i>Nile</i>, the <i>Nigre</i>, and the <i>Zaire</i>: And in
<i>America</i>, the <i>Andes</i> and the <i>Apalatean</i> Mountains;
each of which far surpass the usual height to which the Aqueous Vapours
of themselves ascend, and on the tops of which the Air is so cold and
rarified, as to retain but a small part of those Vapours, that shall be
brought thither by Winds. Those Vapours therefore that are raised
copiously in the Sea, and by the Wind, are carried over the low Land to
those Ridges of Mountains, are there compelled by the Stream of the Air
to mount up with it to the tops of the Mountains, where the Water
presently precipitates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
gleeting down by the Crannies of the Stone; and part of the Vapour
entering into the Caverns of the Hills, the Water thereof gathers as in
an Alembick into the Basons of Stone it finds; which being once fill'd,
all the overplus of Water that comes thither runs over by the lowest
place, and breaking out by the sides of the Hills, forms single
<i>Springs</i>. Many of these running down by the Valleys or Guts
between the Ridges of the Hills, and coming to unite, form little
Rivulets, or Brooks: Many of these again, meeting in one common Valley
and gaining the plain Ground, being grown less rapid, become a River;
and many of these being united in one common Channel, make such Streams
as the <i>Rhine</i>, the <i>Rhone</i>, the <i>Danube</i>; which latter,
one would hardly think the Collection of Water condensed out of Vapour,
unless we consider how vast a Tract of Ground that River drains, and
that it is the Sum of all those Springs which break out on the South
side of the <i>Carpathian</i> Mountains, and on the North side of the
immense Ridge of the <i>Alps</i>, which is one continued Chain of
Mountains from <i>Switzerland</i>, to the <i>Black-Sea</i>. And it may
almost pass for a Rule, that the magnitude of a River, or the quantity
of Water it evacuates, is proportionable to the length and height of the
Ridges from whence its Fountains arise. Now this Theory of
<i>Springs</i> is not a bare <i>Hypothesis</i>, but founded on
Experience, which it was my luck to gain in my abode at St.
<i>Helena</i>, where in the Night-time, on the tops of the Hills, about
800 Yards above the Sea, there was so strange a condensation, or rather
precipitation of the Vapours, that it was a great Impediment to my
Cœlestial Observations; for in the clear Sky, the Dew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
would fall so fast, as to cover, each half quarter of an Hour, my
Glasses with little drops; so that I was necessitated to wipe them so
often, and my Paper on which I wrote my Observations would immediately
be so wet with Dew, that it would not bear Ink: By which it may be
suppos'd how fast the Water gathers in those mighty high Ridges I but
now nam'd.</p>

<p>Thus is one part of the Vapours blown upon the Land return'd by the
Rivers into the Sea, from whence they came; another part by the cool of
the Night falls in Dews, or else in Rains, again into the Sea before it
reaches the Land, which is by much the greatest part of the whole
Vapours, because of the great extent of the Ocean, which the motion of
the Wind does not traverse in a very long space of Time; and this is the
Reason why the Rivers do not return so much into the
<i>Mediterranean</i>, as is extracted into Vapour. A third part falls on
the Low-Lands, and is the <i>Pabulum</i> of Plants, where yet it does
not rest, but is again exhaled in Vapour by the action of the Sun, and
is either carried by the Winds to the Sea to fall in Rain or Dew there,
or else to the Mountains to be there turn'd into Springs; and tho' this
does not immediately come to pass, yet after several Vicissitudes of
rising in Vapour, and falling in Rain or Dews, each Particle of the
Water is at length return'd to the Sea from whence it came. Add to this,
that the Rain-waters after the Earth is fully sated with moisture, does,
by the Vallies or lower parts of the Earth, find its way into the
Rivers, and so is compendiously sent back to the Sea. After this manner
is the Circulation perform'd, and I doubt not but this Hypothesis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
is more reasonable than that of those who derive all Springs from the
Rain-waters, which yet are perpetual and without diminution, even when
no Rain falls for a long space of time; or that derive them from a
Filtration or Percolation of the Sea-waters, thro' certain imaginary
Tubes or Passages within the Earth wherein they lose their Saltness.
This, besides many others, labouring under this principal Absurdity,
that the greatest Rivers have their most copious Fountains farthest from
the Sea, and whether so great quantities of fresh Water cannot
reasonably be deriv'd any other way than in Vapour. This, if we may
allow final Causes, seems to be the design of the Hills, that their
Ridges being plac'd thro' the midst of the Continents, might serve, as
it were, for Alembicks to distil fresh Water for the use of Man and
Beast, and their heights to give a descent to those Streams to run
gently, like so many Veins, of the <i>Macrocosm</i> to be the more
beneficial to the Creation. If the difference between Rain and Dew, and
the cause why sometimes 'tis Cloudy, at other times Serene, be inquir'd,
I can offer nothing like a proper Solution thereof, only with submission
to propose Conjectures, which are the best I can find, <i>viz.</i> That
the Air being heaped up by the meeting of two contrary Winds, when the
<i>Mercury</i> is high, the Vapours are the better sustain'd and kept
from Co-agulating or Condensing into Drops, whereby Clouds are not so
easily generated, and the Night the Vapours fall down single, as they
rose in imperceptible Atoms of Water: Whereas, when the <i>Mercury</i>
is low, And the Air rarified by the Exhaustion thereof,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
by two contrary Winds blowing from the place; the Atoms of Air keep the
Vapours not so well separated, and they coalesce into visible Drops in
the Clouds, and from thence are easily drawn into greater Drops of Rain;
to which 'tis possible and not improbable, that some sort of Saline or
Angular Particles of Terrestrial Vapour being immix'd with the Aqueous,
which I take to be Bubbles, may cut or break their Skins or Coats, and
so contribute to their more speedy Condensation into Rain.</p>

<h3>The True Theory of the Tides, extracted from that admired Treatise
of Mr. <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>, Intitled, <strong>Philosophiæ
Naturalis Principia Mathematica</strong>; Being a Discourse presented
with that Book to the late King <strong>James</strong>, by Mr.
<strong>Edmund Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">IT <i>may, perhaps, seem strange, that this Paper,
being no other than a particular Account of a Book long since published,
should now appear here; but the Desires of several honourable Persons,
which could not be withstood, have obliged us to insert it here, for the
sake of such, who being less knowing in Mathematical Matters, and
therefore not daring to adventure on the Author himself, are
notwithstanding, very curious to be inform'd of the Causes of Things;
particularly of so general and extraordinary <strong>Phænomena</strong>,
as are those of the Tides. Now this Paper having been drawn up for the
late King <strong>James</strong>'s Use, (in whose Reign the Book was
publish'd) and having given good Satisfaction to those that got Copies
of it; it is hoped the Savans of the higher Form will indulge us this
Liberty we take to gratifie their Inferiours in point of Science; and
not be offended, that we here insist more largely upon Mr.
<strong>Newton</strong>'s <strong>Theory of the Tides</strong>, which,
how plain and easie soever we find, is very little understood by the
common Reader.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">THE
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
sole Principle upon which this Author proceeds to explain most of the
great and surprizing Appearances of Nature, is no other than that of
<i>Gravity</i>, whereby in the Earth all Bodies have a tendency towards
its Centre; as is most evident: And from undoubted Arguments it's
proved, that there is such a Gravitation towards the Centre of the Sun,
Moon, and all the Planets.</p>

<p>From this Principle, as a necessary Consequence, follows the Sphærical
Figure of the Earth and Sea, and of all the other Cœlestial Bodies: And
tho' the tenacity and firmness of the Solid Parts, support the
Inequalities of the Land above the Level; yet the Fluids, pressing
equally and easily yielding to each other, soon restore the
<i>Æquilibrium</i>, if disturbed, and maintain the exact Figure of the
Globe.</p>

<p>Now this force of Descent of Bodies towards the Centre, is not in all
places alike, but is still less and less, as the distance from the
Center encreases: And in this Book it is demonstrated, that this Force
decreases as the Square of the distance increases; that is, the weight
of Bodies, and the Force of their Fall is less, in parts more removed
from the Center, in the proportion of the Squares of the Distance. So as
for Example, a Ton weight on the Surface of the Earth, if it were raised
to the height of 4000 Miles, which I suppose the Semidiameter of the
Earth, would weigh but ¼ of a Ton, or 5 Hundred weight: If to 12000
Miles, or 3 Semidiameters from the Surface, that is 4 from the Center,
it would weigh but <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> part of the Weight
on the Surface, or a Hundred and Quarter: So that it would be as easie
for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
Strength of a Man at that height to carry a Ton weight, as here on the
Surface a 100¼. And in the same Proportion does the Velocities of the
fall of Bodies decrease: For whereas on the Surface of the Earth all
things fall 16 Foot in a second; at one Semidiameter above, this fall is
but four Foot; and at three Semidiameters, or four from the Centre, it
is but <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> of the Fall at the Surface, or
but one Foot in a second: And at greater Distances both Weight and Fall
become very small, but yet at all given Distances is still some thing,
tho' the Effect become insensible. At the distance of the Moon (which I
will suppose 60 Semidiameters of the Earth) 3600 Pounds weigh but one
Pound, and the fall of Bodies is but of
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3600</sub> a Foot in a second, or 16 Foot in a
Minute; that is, a Body so far off descends in a Minute no more than the
same at the Surface of the Earth would do in a Second of Time.</p>

<p>As was said before, the same force decreasing after the same manner
is evidently found in the Sun, Moon, and all the Planets; but more
especially in the Sun, whose Force is prodigious; becoming sensible even
in the immense distance of <i>Saturn</i>: This gives room to suspect,
that the force of Gravity is in the Cœlestial Globes proportional to the
quantity of Matter in each of them: And the Sun being at least ten
Thousand times as big as the Earth, its Gravitation or attracting Force,
is found to be at least ten Thousand times as much as that of the Earth,
acting on Bodies at the same distance.</p>

<p>This Law of the decrease of Gravity being demonstratively proved, and
put past contradiction; the Author with great Sagacity, inquires into
the necessary Consequences of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
Supposition; whereby he finds the genuine Cause of the several
Appearances in the Theory of the Moon and Planets, and discovers the
hitherto unknown Laws of the Motion of Comets, and of the Ebbing and
flowing of the Sea. Each of which are Subjects that have hitherto taken
up much larger Volumes; but Truth being uniform, and always the same, it
is admirable to observe how easily we are enabled to make out very
abstruse <i>and difficult Matters</i>, when once true and genuine
Principles are obtain'd: And on the other hand it may be wondred; that,
notwithstanding the great facility of truth, and the perplexity and
nonconsequences that always attend erroneous Suppositions, these great
Discoveries should have escaped the acute Disquisitions of the best
Philosophical Heads of all past Ages, and be reserv'd to these our
Times. But that wonder will soon cease, if it be consider'd how great
improvements Geometry has receiv'd in our Memory, and particularly from
the profound Discoveries of our incomparable Author.</p>

<p>The Theory of the Motion of the primary <i>Planets</i> is here shewn
to be nothing else, but the contemplation of the Curve Lines which
Bodies cast with a given Velocity, in a given Direction, and at the same
time drawn towards the Sun by its gravitating Power, would describe. Or,
which is all one, that the Orbs of the Planets are such Curve Lines as a
Shot from a Gun describes in the Air, being cast according to the
direction of the Piece, but bent in a crooked Line by the supervening
Tendency towards the Earths Centre: And the Planets being supposed to be
projected with a given Force, and attracted towards the Sun, after the
aforesaid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
manner, are here proved to describe such Figures, as answer punctually
to all that the Industry of this and the last Age has observed in the
Planetary Motions. So that it appears, that there is no need of solid
Orbs and Intelligences, as the Antients imagin'd, nor yet of
<i>Vortices</i> or Whirlpools of the Cœlestial Matter, as <i>Des
Cartes</i> supposes; but the whole Affair is simply and mechanically
performed, upon the sole Supposition of a Gravitation towards the Sun;
which cannot be denied.</p>

<p>The Motion of <i>Comets</i> is here shewn to be compounded of the
same Elements, and not to differ from Planets, but in their greater
swiftness, whereby overpowering the Gravity that should hold them to the
Sun, as it doth the Planets, they flie off again, and distance
themselves from the Sun and Earth, so that they soon are out of our
sight. And the imperfect Accounts and Observations Antiquity has left
us, are not sufficient to determine whether the same Comet ever return
again. But this Author has shewn how Geometrically to determine the Orb
of a Comet from Observations, and to find his Distance from the Earth
and Sun, which was never before done.</p>

<p>The third thing here done is the Theory of the Moon, all the
Inequalities of whose Motion are proved to arise from the same
Principles, only here the effect of two Centers operating on, or
attracting a projected Body, comes to be considered; for the Moon,
though principally attracted by the Earth, and moving round it, does
together with the Earth, move round the Sun once a Year, and is,
according as she is nearer or farther from the Sun, drawn by him more or
less than the Center of the Earth, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
which she moves; whence arise several Irregularities in her Motion, of
all which, the Author in this Book, with no less Subtility than
Industry, has given a full account. And though by reason of the great
Complication of the Problem, he has not yet been able to make it purely
Geometrical, 'tis to be hoped, that in some farther Essay he may
surmount the difficulty: And having perfected the Theory of the Moon,
the long desir'd Discovery of the Longitude (which at Sea is only
practicable this way) may at length be brought to light, to the great
Honour of your Majesty, and Advantage of your Subjects.</p>

<p>All the surprising Phænomena of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, are
in like manner shewn to proceed from the same Principle; which I design
more largely to insist on, since the Matter of Fact is in this Case much
better known to your Majesty than in the foregoing.</p>

<p>If the Earth were alone, that is to say, not affected by the Actions of
the Sun and Moon, it is not to be doubted, but the Ocean, being equally
press'd by the force of Gravity towards the Center, would continue in a
perfect Stagnation, always at the same height, without either Ebbing or
Flowing; but it being here demonstrated, that the Sun and Moon have a
like Principle of Gravitation towards their Centers, and that the Earth
is within the Activity of their Attractions, it will plainly follow,
that the Equality of the pressure of Gravity towards the Center will
thereby be disturb'd; and though the smallness of these Forces, in
respect of the Gravitation towards the Earth's Center, renders them
altogether imperceptible by any Experiments we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
can devise, yet the Ocean being fluid and yielding to the least force,
by its rising shews where it is less press'd, and where it is more
press'd by its sinking.</p>

<p>Now if we suppose the force of the Moon's Attaction to decrease as
the Square of the Distance from its Center increases (as in the Earth
and other Cœlestial Bodies) we shall find, that where the Moon is
perpendicularly either above or below the Horizon, either in Zenith or
Nadir, there the force of Gravity is most of all diminished, and
consequently that there the Ocean must necessarily swell by the coming
in of the Water from those parts where the Pressure is greatest,
<i>viz.</i> in those places where the Moon is near the Horizon: But that
this may be the better understood, I thought it needful to add the
following Figure, (<i>Vide Fig. 1. Plate 1.</i>) where <i>M</i> is the
Moon, <i>E</i> the Earth, <i>C</i> its Center, and <i>Z</i> the place
where the Moon is in the Zenith, <i>N</i> where in the Nadir.</p>

<p>Now by the Hypothesis it is evident, that the Water in <i>Z</i>,
being nearer, is more drawn by the Moon, than the Center of the Earth
<i>C</i>, and that again more than the Water in <i>N</i>; wherefore the
Water in <i>Z</i> hath a tendency towards the Moon, contrary to that of
Gravity, being equal to the excess of the Gravitation in <i>Z</i>, above
that in <i>C</i>: And in the other case, the Water in <i>N</i>, tending
less towards the Moon than the Center <i>C</i>, will be less pressed, by
as much as is the difference of the Gravitation towards the Moon in
<i>C</i> and <i>N</i>. This rightly understood, it follows plainly, that
the Sea, which otherwise would be Spherical, upon the Pressure of the
Moon, must form it self into a Spheroidal or Oval Figure, whose longest
Diameter is where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
the Moon is vertical, and shortest where she is in the Horizon; and that
the Moon shifting her Position as she turns round the Earth once a Day,
this Oval of Water shifts with her, occasioning thereby the two Floods
and Ebbs observable in each 25 Hours.</p>

<p>And this may suffice, as to the general Cause of the Tides; it
remains now to shew how naturally this Motion accounts for all the
Particulars that have been observ'd about them; so that there can be no
room left to doubt, but that this is the true cause thereof.</p>

<p>The Spring Tides upon the New and Full Moons, and Neap Tides on the
Quarters, are occasion'd by the attractive Force of the Sun in the New
and Full, conspiring with the Attraction of the Moon, and producing a
Tide by their united Forces: Whereas in the Quarters, the Sun raises the
Water where the Moon depresses it, and the contrary; so as the Tides are
made only by the difference of their Attractions. That the force of the
Sun is no greater in this Case, proceeds from the very small Proportion
the Semi-diameter of the Earth bears to the vast distance of the Sun.</p>

<p>It is also observ'd, that <i>cæteris paribus</i>, the Æquinoctial
Spring Tides in <i>March</i> and <i>September</i>, or near them, are the
Highest, and the Neap Tides the lowest; which proceeds from the greater
Agitations of the Waters, when the fluid <i>Spheroid</i> revolves about
a great Circle of the Earth, than when it turns about in a lesser
Circle; it being plain that if the Moon were constituted in the Pole,
and there stood, that the <i>Spheroid</i> would have a fix'd Position,
and that it would be always high Water under the Poles, and low Water
every where under the Æquinoctial:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
And therefore the nearer the Moon approaches the Poles, the less is the
agitation of the Ocean, which is of all the greatest, when the Moon is
in the Æquinoctial, or farthest distant from the Poles. Whence the Sun
and Moon, being either conjoined or opposite in the Æquinoctial, produce
the greatest Spring Tides; and the subsequent Neap Tides, being produc'd
by the Tropical Moon in the Quarters, are always the least Tides;
whereas in <i>June</i> and <i>December</i>, the Spring Tides are made by
the Tropical Sun and Moon, and therefore less vigorous; and the Neap
Tides by the Æquinoctial Moon, which therefore are the stronger: Hence
it happens, that the difference between the Spring and Neap Tides in
these Months, is much less considerable than in <i>March</i> and
<i>September</i>. And the reason why the very highest Spring Tides are
found to be rather before the Vernal and after the Autumnal Equinox,
<i>viz.</i> in <i>February</i> and <i>October</i>, than precisely upon
them, is, because the Sun is nearer the Earth in the Winter Months, and
so comes to have a greater effect in producing the Tides.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have consider'd such Affections of the Tides as are
Universal, without relation to particular Cases; what follows from the
differing Latitudes of places, will be easily understood by the
following Fig. (<i>Vide Fig. 2. Plate 1.</i>)</p>

<p>Let <i>ApEP</i> be the Earth cover'd over with very deep Waters,
<i>C</i> its Center, <i>P</i>, <i>p</i>, its Poles, <i>AE</i> the
Æquinoctial, <i>F</i>, <i>f</i>, the parallel of Latitude of a Place,
<i>D</i>, <i>d</i>, another Parallel at equal distance on the other side
of the Æquinoctial, <i>H</i>, <i>h</i>, the two Points where the Moon is
vertical, and let <i>K</i>, <i>k</i>, be the great Circle, wherein the
Moon appears Horizontal. It is evident, that a Spheroid describ'd upon
<i>Hh</i>, and <i>Kk</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
shall nearly represent the Figure of the Sea, and <i>Cf</i>, <i>CD</i>,
<i>CF</i>, <i>Cd</i>, shall be the heighths of the Sea in the places
<i>f</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>d</i>, in all which it is High-water:
And seeing that in twelve Hours time, by the diurnal Rotation of the
Earth, the Point <i>F</i> is transferr'd to <i>f</i>, and <i>d</i> to
<i>D</i>: The height of the Sea <i>CF</i> will be that of the High-water
when the Moon is present, and <i>Cf</i> that of the other High-water,
when the Moon is under the Earth: Which in the case of this Figure is
less than the former <i>CF</i>. And in the opposite Parallel <i>Dd</i>,
the contrary happens. The Rising of the Water being always alternately
greater and less in each place, when it is produc'd by the Moon
declining sensibly from the Æquinoctial; that being the greatest of the
two High-waters in each diurnal Revolution of the Moon, wherein she
approaches nearest either to the Zenith or Nadir of the place: Whence it
is, that the Moon in the Northern Signs, in this part of the World,
makes the greatest Tides when above the Earth, and in Southern Signs,
when under the Earth; the Effect being always the greatest where the
Moon is farthest from the Horizon, either above or below it. And this
alternate Increase and Decrease of the Tides has been observ'd to hold
true on the Coast of <i>England</i>, at <i>Bristol</i> by Captain
<i>Sturmy</i>, and at <i>Plymouth</i> by Mr. <i>Colepresse</i>.</p>

<p>But the Motions hitherto mentioned are somewhat alter'd by the
Libration of the Water, whereby, though the Action of the
<i>Luminaries</i> should cease, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea would for
some time continue: This Conservation of the impress'd Motion diminishes
the differences that otherwise would be between two consequent Tides,
and is the reason why the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
highest Spring-Tides are not precisely on the New and Full Moons, nor
the Neaps on the Quarters; but generally they are the third Tides after
them, and sometimes later.</p>

<p>All these things would regularly come to pass, if the whole Earth
were cover'd with Sea very deep; but by reason of the shoalness of some
places, and the narrowness of the Streights, by which the Tides are in
many cases propagated, there arises a great diversity in the Effect, and
not to be accounted for, without an exact Knowledge of all the
Circumstances of the Places, as of the Position of the Land, and the
Breadth and Depth of the Channels by which the Tide flows; for a very
slow and imperceptible Motion of the whole Body of the Water, where it
is (for Example) 2 Miles deep, will suffice to raise its Surface 10 or
12 Feet in a Tides time; whereas, if the same quantity of Water were to
be convey'd up a Channel of 40 Fathoms deep, it would require a very
great Stream to effect it, in so large Inlets as are the Channel of
<i>England</i>, and the <i>German</i> Ocean; whence the Tide is found to
set strongest in those places where the Sea grows narrowest; the same
quantity of Water being to pass through a smaller Passage: This is most
evident in the <i>Streights</i>, between <i>Portland</i> and <i>Cape de
Hague</i> in <i>Normandy</i>, where the Tide runs like a Sluce; and
would be yet more between <i>Dover</i> and <i>Calais</i>, if the Tide
coming about the Island from the North did not check it. And this force
being once impress'd upon the Water, continues to carry it above the
level of the ordinary height in the Ocean, particularly where the Water
meets a direct Obstacle, as it is at St. <i>Malo's</i>; and where it
enters into a long Channel, which running far into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
the Land, grows very streight at its Extremity; as it is in the
<i>Severn-Sea</i> at <i>Chepstow</i> and <i>Bristol</i>.</p>

<p>This shoalness of the Sea, and the intercurrent Continents are the
reason, that in the open Ocean the time of High water is not at the
Moons appulse to the Meridian, but always some Hours after it; as it is
observ'd upon all the West Coast of <i>Europe</i> and <i>Africa</i>,
from <i>Ireland</i> to the <i>Cape of Good Hope</i>: In all which a S.
W. Moon makes High-water, and the same is reported to be on the West
side of <i>America</i>. But it would be endless to account all the
particular Solutions, which are easie Corollaries of this
<i>Hypothesis</i>; as why the <i>Lakes</i>, such as the <i>Caspian
Sea</i>, and <i>Mediterranean Seas</i>, such as the <i>Black Sea</i>,
the <i>Streights</i> and <i>Baltick</i>, have no sensible Tides: For
<i>Lakes</i> having no Communication with the Ocean, can neither
increase nor diminish their Water, whereby to rise and fall; and Seas
that communicate by such narrow Inlets, and are of so immense an Extent,
cannot in a few Hours time receive or empty Water enough to raise or
sink their Surface any thing sensibly.</p>

<p>Lastly, to demonstrate the Excellency of this Doctrine, the Example
of the Tides in the Port of <i>Tunking</i> in <i>China</i>, which are so
extraordinary, and differing from all others we have yet heard of, may
suffice. In this Port there is but one Flood and Ebb in 24 Hours; and
twice in each Month, <i>viz.</i> when the Moon is near the Æquinoctial
there is no Tide at all, but the Water is stagnant; but with the Moons
Declination there begins a Tide, which is greatest when she is in the
Tropical Signs: Only with this difference, that when the Moon is to the
Northward of the Æquinoctial, it Flows when she is above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
the Earth, and Ebbs when she is under, so as to make High-water at
Moons-setting, and Low-water at Moons-rising: But on the contrary, the
Moon being to the Southward, makes High-water at rising, and Low-water
at setting; it Ebbing all the time she is above the Horizon. As may be
seen more at large in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, Numb. 162.</p>

<p>The Cause of this odd Appearance is propos'd by Mr. <i>Newton</i>, to
be from the concurrence of two Tides; the one propagated in six Hours
out of the great <i>South-Sea</i> along the Coast of <i>China</i>; the
other out of the <i>Indian-Sea</i>, from between the Islands in twelve
Hours, along the Coast of <i>Malacca</i> and <i>Cambodia</i>. The one of
these Tides, being produc'd in North Latitude, is, as has been said,
greater, when the Moon being to the North of the Equator is above the
Earth, and less when she is under the Earth. The other of them, which is
propagated from the <i>Indian Sea</i>, being raised in South-Latitude,
is greater when the Moon declining to the South, is above the Earth, and
less when she is under the Earth: So that of these Tides alternately
greater and lesser, there comes always successively two of the greater
and two of the lesser together every Day; and the High-water falls
always between the times of the arrival of the two greater Floods; and
the Low-water between the arrival of the two lesser Floods. And the Moon
coming to the Æquinoctial, and the alternate Floods becoming equal, the
Tide ceases, and the Water stagnates: But when she has pass'd to the
other side of the Equator, those Floods which in the former Order were
the least, now becoming the greatest, that That before was the time of
High-water, now becomes the Low-water, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
the Converse. So that the whole appearance of these strange Tides, is
without any forcing naturally deduc'd from these Principles, and is a
great Argument of the Certainty of the whole <i>Theory</i>.</p>

<h3>A Theory of the <strong>Variation</strong> of the <strong>Magnetical
Compass</strong>. By Mr. <strong>Ed. Halley</strong>, Fellow of the
Royal Society.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE Variation of the Compass (by which I mean the Deflection of the
Magnetical Needle from the true Meridian) is of that great Concernment
in the Art of Navigation, that the neglect thereof, does little less
than render useless one of the noblest Inventions Mankind ever yet
attained to. And for this cause all Ships of Consequence (especially
those bound beyond the Equator) carry with them Instruments on purpose
to observe this Variation: That so the Course steer'd by the Compass,
may be reduc'd to the true Course in respect of the Meridian.</p>

<p>Now although the great utility that a perfect Knowledge of the Theory
of the Magnetical Direction would afford to Mankind in general, and
especially to those concern'd in Sea Affairs, seems as sufficient
incitement to all Philosophical and Mathematical Heads, to take under
serious Consideration the several <i>Phænomena</i>, and to endeavour to
reconcile them by some general Rule: Yet so it is; that almost all the
Authors, from whom a Discourse of this kind ought to have been expected,
pass by in silence the Difficulties they here Encounter. And those that
mention this Variation: By affirming it to proceed from Causes
altogether uncertain (as are the casual lying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
of Iron Mines and Loadstones in the Earth) put a stop to all further
Contemplation; and give discouragement to those that would otherwise
undertake this Enquiry. 'Tis true, that not long since one Mr.
<i>Bond</i>, an old Teacher of Navigation, put forth a small Treatise,
wherein he pretends to calculate the Variation: But he limits his
Hypothesis to the City of <i>London</i>, affirming himself (as he had a
great deal of reason) that the same <i>Calculus</i> is not sufficient
for other Places; whereby it appears that this Rule is far short of the
so much desir'd general one.</p>

<p>Now although (through want of sufficient Observations, and some other
Difficulties, which I shall anon shew) I cannot pretend perfectly to
establish the Numbers and Rules of a <i>Calculus</i>, which shall
precisely answer to the Variations of all parts of the World: Yet I
suppose it will not be unacceptable to the Curious to propose something
of a Light into this abstruse Mystery; which, if no other, may have this
good Effect, to stir up the Philosophical <i>Genii</i> of the Age to
apply themselves more attentively to this useful Speculation. But before
I proceed, 'twill be necessary to lay down the Grounds upon which I
raise my Conclusions; and at once to give a Synopsis of those
Variations, which I have reason to look upon as sure, being mostly the
Observations of Persons of good Skill and Integrity.</p>

<p>Tho' I could wish we could obtain from the <i>Spaniards</i> what
Variations they find in their Voyages from the <i>Manilhas</i> towards
<i>Acapulco</i>, through the North part of the South Sea; as likewise
what it is at <i>Japan</i> from the <i>Dutch</i>: Yet (considering the
number of these Observations I have collected, and that they are made in
parts of the World so remote from <i>Europe</i>, and from one another) I
suppose that the Theory that answers these will scarce fail in those
Regions from whence we have as yet no account. But first we must make
some Remarks upon the foregoing Table: And, First,</p>

<p>That in all <i>Europe</i> the Variation at this time is West, and
more in the Eastern Parts thereof than the Western: As likewise, that it
seems throughout to be upon the increase that way.</p>

<p>Secondly, That on the Coast of <i>America</i>, about <i>Virginia</i>,
<i>New-England</i> and <i>New-Foundland</i>, the Variation is likewise
Westerly; and that it increases all the way as you go Northerly along
the Coast, so as to be above 20 Degrees at <i>New-Found-Land</i>, nearly
30 gr. in <i>Hudson's Straights</i>, and not less than 57 Degrees in
<i>Baffin's Bay</i>; also, that as you Sail Eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
from this Coast, the Variation diminishes. From these two it is a
Legitimate Corollary: That <i>Somewhere between</i> Europe, <i>and the
North part of</i> America, <i>there ought to be an Easterly Variation,
or at least no Westerly</i>. And so I conjecture it is about the
Eastermost of the <i>Tercera Islands</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That on the Coast of <i>Brasile</i> there is East Variation,
which increases very notably as you go to the Southward, so as to be 12
Degrees at <i>Cape Frio</i>, and over against the River of <i>Plate</i>
20½ Degrees: And from thence Sailing South-Westerly to the Straits of
<i>Magellan</i> it decreases 17 Degrees, and at the West Entrance but 14
Degrees.</p>

<p>Fourthly, That at the Eastward of <i>Brasile</i>, properly so call'd,
this Easterly Variation decreases, so as to be very little at St.
<i>Helena</i> and <i>Ascension</i>, and to be quite gone, and the
Compass Point true about 18 Degrees of Longitude West from the Cape of
<i>Good-hope</i>.</p>

<p>Fifthly, That to the Eastward of the aforesaid Places a Westward
Variation begins, which Reigns in the whole <i>Indian</i> Sea, and
arises to no less than Eighteen Degrees under the Equator it self, about
the Meridian of the Northern part of <i>Madagascar</i>; and near the
same Meridian, but in 39 Degrees South Latitude it is found full 27½
Degrees: From thence Easterly the West Variation decreases, so as to be
little more than eight Degrees at <i>Cape Comorin</i>, and than three
Degrees upon the Coast of <i>Java</i>; and to be quite extinct about the
<i>Molucca Islands</i>, as also a little to the Westwards of <i>Van
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Diemens</i> Land found out by the <i>Dutch</i> in 1642.</p>

<p>Sixthly, That to the Eastward of the <i>Molucca's</i> and <i>Van
Diemens</i> Land in South Latitude there arises another Easterly
Variation, which seems not so great as the former, nor of so large
Extent; for that at the Island <i>Rotterdam</i> it is sensibly less than
upon the East Coast of <i>New Guinea</i>; and, at the rate it decreases,
it may well be suppos'd, that about 20 Degrees farther East, or 225
Degrees East Longitude from <i>London</i>, in the Latitude of 20 Degrees
South, a Westerly Variation begins.</p>

<p>Seventhly, That the Variations observ'd by the Honourable Sir <i>John
Norborough</i> at <i>Baldivia</i>, and at the West Entrance of the
<i>Straights</i> of <i>Magellan</i> do plainly shew, that That East
Variation, noted in our third Remark, is decreasing apace; and that it
cannot reasonably extend many Degrees into the South Sea from the Coast
of <i>Peru</i> and <i>Chili</i>, leaving room for a small Westerly
Variation, in that Tract of the unknown World that lies in the mid-way
between <i>Chili</i> and <i>New-Zealand</i>, and between
<i>Hounds-Island</i> and <i>Peru</i>.</p>

<p>Eighthly, That in Sailing North-West from St. <i>Helena</i> by
<i>Ascension</i>, as far as the Equator, the Variation continues very
small East, and as it were constantly the same: So that in this part of
the World the Course, wherein there is no Variation, is evidently no
Meridian, but rather North-West.</p>

<p>Ninthly, That the Entrance of <i>Hudson's Straights</i>, and the
Mouth of the River of <i>Plate</i>, being nearly under the same
Meridian, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
one place the Needle varies 29½ Degrees to the <i>West</i>; at the other
20½ Degrees to the <i>East</i>. This plainly demonstrates the
impossibility of reconciling these Variations by the Theory of
<i>Bond</i>; <i>which is by two Magnetical Poles and an Axis, inclin'd
to the Axis of the Earth</i>; from whence it would follow, That <i>under
the same Meridian the Variation should be in all places the same
way</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">These things being premised may serve as a sure
Foundation to raise the Superstructure of a Theory upon. But first it
would not be amiss to shew hereby the mistake of <i>Gilbert</i> and
<i>Des Cartes</i>: The first whereof supposes, that <i>the Earth it self
being in all its parts Magnetical, and the Water not; wheresoever the
Land is, thither also should the Needle turn, as to the greater quantity
of Magnetical Matter</i>. But this in many Instances is not true; but
most remarkably upon the Coast of <i>Brazile</i>, where the Needle is so
far from being attracted by the Land, that it turns the quite contrary
way, leaving the Meridian to lye N b E, which is just along the Coast.
As to the Position of <i>Des Cartes</i>, <i>that the Iron and Loadstones
hid in the Bowels of the Earth and the Bottom of the Sea, may be the
Causes that the Needle varies</i>; if we consider for how great a part
of the Earths Surface, <i>ex. gr.</i> in the whole <i>Indian</i> Sea,
the Needle declines the same way, and that regularly, 'twill follow that
the attracting Substance that occasions it, must be very far distant.
Now by Experience we find the little force that Iron Guns have upon the
Compass in Ships (their Vertue, though they be Demiculverin, or greater
Cannon, being not perceptible at four or five Yards distance) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
the Experiments now before the <i>Royal Society</i> do plainly shew, how
little a Magnetism there is in most crude Iron Oars: What quantity
thereof must be then suppos'd to make so powerful a Diversion at two or
three Thousand Miles distance? Yet I cannot deny that in some places
near the Shoar, or in Shoal-Water, the Needle may be irregularly
directed from the aforesaid Causes, and that not a little, as
<i>Gassendus</i> gives a notable instance of the Island <i>Elba</i> in
the Mediterranean Sea: But these differences from the general Direction
are always signs of the nearness of those Magnetical Substances, for the
Production whereof that Island <i>Elba</i> has been famous from all
Antiquity. Besides, against both <i>Des Cartes</i> and <i>Gilbert</i>,
the change of the Variation, which has been within these Hundred Years
last past more than 15 gr. at <i>London</i>, is an entire Demonstration;
tho' <i>Des Cartes</i> does not stick to say, that the transportation of
Iron from place to place, and the growth of new Iron within the Earth,
where there was none before, may be the cause thereof. The same holds
likewise against the <i>Hypothesis</i> of <i>Magnetical Fibres</i>,
which <i>Kircher</i> maintains.</p>

<p>Now to propose something that may answer the several appearances, and
introduce nothing strange in Philosophy, after a great many close
Thoughts, I can come to no other Conclusion than that, <i>The whole
Globe of the Earth is one great Magnet, having four Magnetical Poles, or
Points of Attraction, near each Pole of the Equator. Two; and that, in
those parts of the World which lie near adjacent to any one of those
Magnetical Poles, the Needle is govern'd thereby, the nearest Pole being
always predominant over the more remote</i>. The parts of the Earth
wherein these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
Magnetical <i>Poles</i> lie, cannot as yet be exactly determin'd for
want of sufficient <i>Data</i> to proceed Geometrically; but, as near as
Conjecture can reach, I reckon that the <i>Pole</i>, which is at present
nearest to us, lies in or near the Meridian of the Lands-end of
<i>England</i>, and not above seven Degrees from the Pole Arctick; by
this <i>Pole</i> the Variations in all <i>Europe</i> and <i>Tartary</i>,
and the <i>North Sea</i> are principally govern'd, though with regard to
the other Northern Pole, whose situation is in a <i>Meridian</i> passing
about the middle of <i>California</i>, and about 15 gr. from the North
Pole of the World; to this the Needle has chiefly respect in all the
North <i>America</i>, and in the two Oceans on either side thereof, from
the <i>Azores</i> Westward to <i>Japan</i>, and farther. The two
Southern Poles are rather farther distant from the South Pole of the
World: The one about sixteen Degrees therefrom, is in a Meridian, some
twenty Degrees to the Westward of <i>Magellan Straights</i>, or ninety
five Degrees West from <i>London</i>: This commands the Needle in all
the <i>South-America</i>, in the <i>Pacifick Sea</i>, and the greatest
part of the <i>Ethiopick</i> Ocean. The Fourth and last <i>Pole</i>
seems to have the greatest Power, and largest Dominions of all, as it is
the most remote from the <i>Pole</i> of the World, being little less
than 20 Degrees distant therefrom in the Meridian, which passes through
<i>Hollandia Nova</i>, and the Island <i>Celebes</i> about one hundred
and twenty Degrees East from <i>London</i>; this Pole is predominant in
the South part of <i>Africa</i>, in <i>Arabia</i> and the <i>Red
Sea</i>, in <i>Persia</i>, <i>India</i>, and its Islands, and all over
the <i>Indian Sea</i>, from the Cape of <i>Good-Hope</i> Eastwards to
the middle of the great South Sea, that divides <i>Asia</i> from
<i>America</i>. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
seems to be the present Disposition of the Magnetical Vertue throughout
the whole Globe of the Earth; it remains to shew how this Hypothesis
makes out all the Variations that have been observ'd of late; and how it
answers to our several Remarks drawn from the Table. And first it is
plain, that (our <i>European</i> North <i>Pole</i> being in the Meridian
of the Lands-end of <i>England</i>) all places more Easterly than that
will have it on the West side of their Meridian, and consequently the
Needle, respecting it with its Northern Point, will have a Westerly
Variation, which will still be greater as you go to the Eastwards, till
you come to some Meridian of <i>Russia</i>, where 'twill be greatest,
and from thence decrease again. Thus at <i>Brest</i> the Variation is
but 1¾ Degrees, at <i>London</i> 4½ Degrees; but at <i>Dantzick</i>
seven Degrees West. To the Westward of the Meridian of the Lands-end,
the Needle ought to have an Easterly Variation; were it not that (by
approaching the <i>American</i> Northern <i>Pole</i>, which lies on the
West side of the Meridian, and seems to be of greater force than this
other) the Needle is drawn thereby Westwards, so as to counterballance
the Direction given by the <i>European Pole</i>, and to make a small
West Variation in the Meridian of the Lands-end it self. Yet I suppose
that about the Meridian of the Isle <i>Tercera</i>, our nearest
<i>Pole</i> may so far prevail as to give the Needle a little turn to
the East, though but for a very small space: The Counterballance of
those two <i>Poles</i> permitting no considerable Variation in all the
Eastern Parts of the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean; nor upon the West Coasts of
<i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i> and
<i>Barbary</i>. But to the Westwards of the <i>Azores</i> the Power of
the <i>American</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
Pole overcoming that of the <i>European</i>, the Needle has chiefly
respect thereto, and turns still more and more towards it as you
approach it. Whence it comes to pass, that on the Coast of
<i>Virginia</i>, <i>New-England</i>, <i>New-found-Land</i>, and in
<i>Hudson's-Straights</i> the Variation is Westward; that it decreases
as you go from thence towards <i>Europe</i>, and that it is less in
<i>Virginia</i> and <i>New-England</i>, than in <i>New-found-Land</i>,
and <i>Hudson's-Straights</i>. This Westerly Variation again decreases,
as you pass over the <i>North America</i>; and about the Meridian of the
middle of <i>California</i> the Needle again points due North; and from
thence Westward to <i>Yedzo</i> and <i>Japan</i>, I make no doubt but
the Variation is Easterly, and half the Sea over no less than fifteen
Degrees, if there be any truth in this Hypothesis of mine. Therefore I
propose this as a Trial, that the whole may be scann'd thereby; and I
conceive it will not be hard to know of the <i>Spaniards</i> how it is,
who so frequently sail through that Ocean, in their return from the
<i>Manilha</i> Isles. This East Variation extends over <i>Japan</i>,
<i>Yedzo</i>, <i>East-Tartary</i>, and part of <i>China</i>, till it
meet with the Westerly, which is govern'd by the <i>European</i> North
Pole, and which I said was greatest some where in <i>Russia</i>.</p>

<p>Towards the Southern Pole the effect is much the same, only that here
the South Point of the Needle is attracted. Hence it will follow, that
the Variation on the Coast of <i>Brazile</i>, at the River of
<i>Plate</i>, and so on to the Straights of <i>Magellan</i>, should be
Easterly (as in our third Remark); if we suppose a Magnetical Pole
situate about twenty Degrees more Westerly than the Straights of
<i>Magellan</i>. And this Easterly Variation doth extend Eastward over
the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
part of the <i>Ethiopick</i> Sea, till it be counterpoised by the Vertue
of the other Southern <i>Pole</i>; as it is about mid-way between the
Cape of <i>Good-Hope</i>, and the Isles of <i>Tristan d' Acuntia</i>.
From thence Eastwards, the <i>Asian</i> South Pole (as I must take the
liberty to call it) becoming prevalent, and the South point of the
Needle being attracted thereby, there arises a West Variation, very
great in quantity and extent, because of the great distance of this
Magnetical Pole of the World. Hence it is, that in all the <i>Indian</i>
Sea as far as <i>Hollandia Nova</i>, and farther, there is constantly
West Variation; at that under the Equator it self it arises to no less
than eighteen Degrees, where 'tis most. About the Meridian of the Island
<i>Celebes</i>, being likewise that of this Pole, this Westerly
Variation ceases, and an Easterly begins; which reaches, according to my
Hypothesis, to the middle of the <i>South-Sea</i>, between <i>Zelandia
Nova</i>, and <i>Chili</i>, leaving room for a small <i>West
Variation</i> govern'd by the <i>American</i> South Pole, which I shew'd
to be in the <i>Pacifick Sea</i>, in the sixth and seventh Remark.</p>

<p>What I have now said, does plainly shew the sufficiency of this
Hypothesis for solving the Variations that are at this time observ'd in
the temperate and frigid <i>Zones</i>, where the Direction of the Needle
chiefly depends upon the Counterpoise of the forces of two Magnetical
Poles of the same Nature; and I suppose I have shewn how it comes to
pass, that under the same Meridian the Variation should be in one place
29½ West, and another 20½ East; as I have noted in my ninth Remark.</p>

<p>In the <i>Torrid Zone</i>, and particularly under
the Equinoctial, respect must be had to all four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
Poles, and their Positions well consider'd, otherwise it will not be
easie to determine what the Variations shall be; the nearest <i>Pole</i>
being always the strongest; yet not so, as not to be counterballanc'd
sometimes by the united forces of two more remote; a notable Instance
whereof is in our eighth Remark, where I took notice, that in sailing
from St. <i>Helena</i> by the Isle of <i>Ascension</i>, to the Equator,
on a N. W. Course, the Variation is very little Easterly, and in that
whole Tract unalterable; for which I give this Reason, That the South
<i>American</i> Pole (which is considerably the nearest in the aforesaid
Places) requiring a great Easterly Variation, is counterpoised by the
contrary Attraction of the <i>North-American</i> and the
<i>Asian-South-Pole</i>; each whereof singly are in these Parts, weaker
than the <i>American-South-Pole</i>; and upon the North West Course, the
Distance from this latter is very little varied; and as you recede from
the <i>Asian-South-Pole</i>, the Ballance is still preserv'd by the
access towards the <i>North-American-Pole</i>. I mention not in this
Case the <i>European-North-Pole</i>, its Meridian being little remov'd
from those of these places; and of it self requiring the same Variations
we here find. After the same manner we might proceed to conclude the
Variations in other places under and near the Equator; but I purposely
leave it for an Exercise to the Thoughts of the serious Reader, who is
desir'd to help his Imagination, by having before him a Map or Globe of
the Earth: And to mark thereon the Magnetical <i>Poles</i> in the
<i>Longitudes</i> and <i>Latitudes</i> I assign them. (<i>Vide Plate
2.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
Thus, I hope, I have not lost my Pains and Study in this difficult
Subject; believing that I have put it past doubt, <i>That there are in
the Earth four such Magnetical Points or Poles, which occasion the great
variety and seeming irregularity which is observed in the Variations of
the Compass</i>. But to calculate exactly what it is, in any place
assign'd, is what I dare not yet pretend to, though I could wish it were
my happiness to be able to oblige the World with so useful a piece of
Knowledge; there are Difficulties that occur, that render the thing as
yet not feasible; for first there are a great many Observations
requisite, which ought to be made at the same time; not at Sea, but
ashore, with greater Care and Attention than the generality of Sailors
apply. And besides, it remains undetermin'd in what proportion the
attractive Power decreases, as you remove from the <i>Pole</i> of a
Magnet, without which it were a vain attempt to go about to calculate.
There is yet a further Difficulty, which is the Change of the Variation,
one of the Discoveries of this last Century; which shews, that it will
require some hundreds of Years to establish a compleat Doctrine of the
Magnetical System. From the foregoing Table it should seem, that all the
Magnetical <i>Poles</i> had a motion Westward: But if it be so, 'tis
evident, that it is not a Rotation about the Axis of the Earth; for then
the Variations would continue the same, in the same parallel of
<i>Latitude</i> (the <i>Longitude</i> only chang'd) as much as is the
motion of the Magnetical <i>Poles</i>, but the contrary is found by
Experience; for there is no where in the Latitude of 15½ North between
<i>England</i> and <i>America</i>, a Variation of eleven Degrees East at
this time;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
as it was once here at <i>London</i>; it seems therefore, that our
<i>European</i> Pole is grown nearer the Pole <i>Arctick</i> than it was
heretofore, or else that it has lost part of its Vertue. But whether
these Magnetical Poles move altogether with one motion, or with several;
whether equally or unequally; whether Circular or Libratory: If
Circular, about what Center; if Libratory, after what manner; are
Secrets as yet utterly unknown to Mankind, and are reserv'd for the
Industry of future Ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<h3>An Account of the Cause of the Change of the Variation of the
Magnetical Needle, with an Hypothesis of the Structure of the Internal
Parts of the Earth; as it was proposed to the <strong>Royal
Society</strong> in one of their late Meetings. By Mr. <strong>Edmund
Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">HAving in the precedent Discourse delivered a Theory
of the Variation of the Magnetical Compass, wherein I did collect as
many Observations as at that time I could procure, and having carefully
compar'd them together, I came at length to this general conclusion,
<i>That the Globe of the Earth might be supposed to be one great Magnet,
having four Magnetical Poles or Points of Attraction, near each Pole of
the Equator two; and that in those parts of the World which lie near
adjacent to any one of those Magnetical Poles, the Needle is chiefly
govern'd thereby; the nearest Pole being always predominant ever the
more remote</i>. And I there have endeavour'd to state and limit the
present Position of those Poles in the Surface of our Globe, which the
Reader pleasing to consult, will save us the pains of repeating. But
after all, tho' that Discourse was favourably receiv'd both at home and
abroad, as seeming to render a tolerable account of the observ'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
Variations, yet I found two Difficulties not easie to surmount; the one
was, that no Magnet I had ever seen or heard of, had more than two
opposite <i>Poles</i>, whereas the Earth had visibly four, and perhaps
more. And secondly, it was plain that these <i>Poles</i> were not, at
least all of them, fixt in the Earth, but shifted from place to place,
as appear'd by the great Changes in the Needles Direction within this
last Century of Years, not only at <i>London</i>, (where this great
Discovery was first made) but almost all over the Globe of Earth;
whereas it is not known or observ'd that the <i>Poles</i> of a
Load-stone ever shifted their place in the Stone, nor (considering the
compact hardness of that Substance) can it easily be suppos'd; though
the Matter of Fact be too notorious and universal, not to be accounted
for.</p>

<p>These Difficulties had wholly made me despond, and I had long since
given over an Inquiry I had so little hopes of, when in accidental
Discourse, and least expecting it, I stumbl'd on the following
Hypothesis; in delivering whereof, if I shall seem to advance any thing
that looks like Extravagant or Romantick, the Reader is desir'd to
suspend his Censure, till he have consider'd the force and number of the
many Arguments which concur to make good so new and so bold a
Supposition.</p>

<p>Though it be sufficiently known and allow'd, that the Needles
Variation changes, it will be necessary however to give a few Instances,
whereby it may appear that this Change is gradual and universal, and the
effect of a great and permanent motion: For which take the following
Examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
At <i>London</i>, in the Year 1580, the Variation was observ'd by Mr.
<i>Burrows</i> to be 11° 15' East. In <i>Anno</i> 1622, the same was
found by Mr. <i>Gunter</i> to be but 6° 0' East. In the Year 1634, Mr.
<i>Gellibrand</i> found it 4° 5' East. In 1657, Mr. <i>Bond</i> observ'd
that there was no Variation at <i>London</i>. <i>Anno</i> 1672, my self
observ'd it 2° 30' to the West; and in the Year 1692, I again found it
6° 00' West. So that in 112 Years the Direction of the Needle has
chang'd no less than seventeen Degrees.</p>

<p>At <i>Paris</i>, <i>Orontius Finæus</i> about the Year 1550, did
account it about eight or nine Degrees East Variation. <i>Anno</i> 1640,
it was found three Degrees East. <i>Anno</i> 1660, there was no
Variation there, and <i>Anno</i> 1681, I found it to be 2° 30' to the
West.</p>

<p>At <i>Cape d' Agulhas</i>, the most Southerly Promontary of
<i>Africa</i>, about the Year 1600, the Needle pointed due North and
South without Variation, whence the <i>Portugueze</i> gave its name.
<i>Anno</i> 1622, there was two Degrees West Variation. <i>Anno</i>
1675, it was 8° 50' West; and in the Year 1691, it was curiously
observ'd not less than eleven Degrees West.</p>

<p>At St. <i>Helena</i>, about the Year 1600, the Needle declin'd eight
Degrees to the East. <i>Anno</i> 1623, it was but 6° 0' East.
<i>Anno</i> 1677, when I was there, I observ'd it accurately on Shoar to
be 0° 40' East; and in 1692 it was found about 1° to the Westward of the
North.</p>

<p>At <i>Cape Comorine</i> in <i>India</i>, in the Year 1620, there was
14° 20' West Variation. In the Year 1680, there was 8° 48', but now
lately in the Year 1688, it was no more than 7° 30', so that here the
Needle has return'd to the East about seven Degrees in seventy Years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
In all the other Examples the Needle has gradually mov'd towards the
West, and the places are too far asunder to be influenc'd by the removal
of any Magnetical Matter, which may by accident be transplac'd within
the Bowels, or on the Surface of the Earth. If more Examples are
desir'd, the Reader may be furnished with them in the <i>Portugueze
Routier</i> of <i>Aleixo de Motta</i> (written about the Year 1600) and
in the Voyage of <i>Beaulieu</i>, both publish'd in Mr.
<i>Thevenot</i>'s first Collection of curious Voyages, Printed at
<i>Paris</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1663; which he is to compare with the Journals
of our late <i>East India</i> Voyagers, and I am assur'd, that it will
be thereby evident, that the Direction of the Needle is in no place
fix'd and constant, tho' in some it change faster than in others: And
where for a long time it has continu'd as it were unalter'd, it is there
to be understood, that the Needle has its greatest Deflection, and is
become Stationary in order to return, like the Sun, in the Tropick.
This, at present, is in the <i>Indian Sea</i>, about the Island
<i>Mauritius</i>, where is the highest West Variation, and in a Tract
tending from thence into the N. N. W. towards the <i>Red-Sea</i> and
<i>Egypt</i>. And in all Places to the Westward of this Tract, all over
<i>Africa</i> and the Seas adjoining, the West Variation will be found
to have encreas'd; and to the Eastwards thereof as in the Example of
<i>Cape Comorine</i>, to have decreased, <i>viz.</i> all over the
<i>East-Indies</i>, and the Islands near it.</p>

<p>After the like manner in that Space of East Variation, which,
beginning near St. <i>Helena</i>, is found all over the South
<i>America</i>, and which at present is highest about the Mouth of
<i>Rio de la Plata</i>, it has been observ'd, that in the Eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
Parts thereof, the Variation of the Needle gradually decreases; but
whether on the contrary it increases in those places which lie more
Westerly than that Tract wherein the highest East Variation is found; or
how it may be in the vast <i>Pacifick Sea</i>, we have not Experience
enough to ascertain, only we may by Analogy infer, that both the East
and West Variations therein do gradually increase and decrease after the
same Rule.</p>

<p>These <i>Phænomena</i> being well understood and duly consider'd, do
sufficiently evince, That the whole Magnetical System is by one, or
perhaps more motions translated, whether Eastwards or Westwards, I shall
anon discuss; that this moving thing is very great, as extending its
effects from Pole to Pole, and that the motion thereof is not <i>per
saltum</i>, but a gradual and regular motion.</p>

<p>Now considering the Structure of our <i>Terraqueous</i> Globe, it
cannot be well suppos'd that a very great part thereof can move within
it, without notably changing its Center of Gravity and the Equilibre of
its Parts, which would produce very wonderful Effects in changing the
Axis of diurnal Rotation, and occasion strange alteration in the Seas
Surface, by Inundations and Recesses thereof, such as History never yet
mention'd. Besides, the solid parts of the Earth are not to be granted
permeably by any other than fluid Substances, of which we know none that
are any ways Magnetical. So that the only way to render this motion
intelligible and possible, is to suppose it to turn about the Center of
the Globe, having its Center of Gravity fix'd and immoveable in the same
common Center of the Earth: And there is yet requir'd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
that this moving internal Substance be loose and detached from the
external Parts of the Earth whereon we live; for otherwise, were it
affix'd thereto, the whole must necessarily move together.</p>

<p>So then the External Parts of the Globe may well be reckon'd as the
Shell, and the Internal as a <i>Nucleus</i> or inner Globe, included
within ours, with a fluid Medium between, which having the same Common
Center and Axis of diurnal Rotation, may turn about with our Earth each
twenty four Hours; only this outer Sphere having its turbinating motion
some small matter either swifter or slower than the internal Ball: And a
very minute Difference in length of time, by many Repetitions becoming
sensible, the Internal Parts will by degrees recede from the External,
and not keeping pace with one another, will appear gradually to move
either Eastwards or Westwards by the difference of their motions.</p>

<p>Now supposing such an Internal Sphere having such a motion, we shall
solve the two great Difficulties we encounter'd in my former Hypothesis:
For if this exteriour Shell of Earth be a Magnet, having its Poles at a
distance from the Poles of diurnal Rotation; and if the Internal
<i>Nucleus</i> be likewise a Magnet, having its Poles in two other
places, distant also from the Axis; and these latter by a gradual and
slow motion change their place in respect of the External; we may then
give a reasonable account of the four Magnetical Poles I presume to have
demonstrated before; as likewise of the Changes of the Needles
Variations, which till now hath been unattempted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
The Period of this Motion being wonderful great, and there being hardly
an hundred Years since these Variations have been duly observ'd, it will
be very hard to bring this Hypothesis to a Calculus, especially since,
though the Variations do increase and decrease regularly in the same
place, yet in differing places, at no great distance, there are found
such casual Changes thereof as can no ways be accounted for by a regular
Hypothesis; as depending upon the unequal and irregular distribution of
the Magnetical Matter within the Substance of the External Shell or Coat
of the Earth, which deflect the Needle from the Position it would
acquire from the effect of the general Magnetism of the whole. Of this
the Variations at <i>London</i> and <i>Paris</i> give a notable
Instance, for the Needle has been constantly about 1°½ more Easterly at
<i>Paris</i> than at <i>London</i>; though it be certain that according
to the general effect, the Difference ought to be the contrary way:
Notwithstanding which, the Variations in both places do change
alike.</p>

<p>Hence, and from some other of like Nature, I conclude, That the two
Poles of the External Globe are fixt in the Earth, and that if the
Needle were wholly govern'd by them, the Variations thereof would be
always the same, with some little Irregularities upon the account I but
just now mention'd: But the Internal Sphere having such a gradual
translation of its Poles, does influence the Needle, and direct it
variously, according to the result of the attractive or directive Power
of each Pole; and consequently there must be a Period of the Revolution
of this Internal Ball, after which the Variations will return again as
before. But if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
shall in future Ages be observ'd otherwise, we must then conclude that
there are more of these Internal Spheres, and more Magnetical Poles than
Four, which at present we have not a sufficient number of Observations
to determine, and particularly in that vast <i>Mar del Zur</i>, which
occupies so great a part of the whole Surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>If then two of the Poles be fixt and two moveable, it remains to
ascertain which they are that keep their place; and though I could wish
we had the Experience of another Century of Years to found our
Conclusions upon, yet I think we may safely determine, That our
<i>European North Pole</i> (which in the precedent Discourse I suppos'd
near the Meridian of the Lands-end of <i>England</i>, and about seven
Degrees therefrom) is that That is moveable of the two Northern Poles,
and that That has chiefly influenc'd the Variations in these parts of
the World: For in <i>Hudson</i>'s Bay, which is under the Direction of
the <i>American</i> Pole, the Change is not observ'd to be near so fast
as in these parts of <i>Europe</i>, though that Pole be much farther
remov'd from the Axis.</p>

<p>As to the South Poles, I take the <i>Asian</i> Pole, which I place
about the Meridian of the Island <i>Celebes</i> to be the fixt, and
consequently the <i>American</i> Pole to move; from the like Observation
of the slow Decrease of the Variation on the Coast of <i>Java</i>, and
near the Meridian of the <i>Asian</i> Pole; though I must confess to
have no account of the effects of the other beyond <i>Magellan</i>'s
Streights.</p>

<p>If this be allow'd me, 'tis plain that the fixt Poles are the Poles
of this External Shell or Cortex of the <i>Earth</i>, and the other two
the Poles of a Magnetical <i>Nucleus</i> included and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
moveable within the other. It likewise follows, that this Motion is
Westwards, and by consequence that the aforesaid <i>Nucleus</i> has not
precisely attained the same degree of Velocity with the exteriour Parts
in their diurnal Revolution; but so very nearly equals it, that in 365
Revolves the difference is scarce sensible. This I conceive to arise
from the Impulse whereby this diurnal Motion was imprest on the Earth,
being given to the External Parts, and from thence in time communicated
to the Internal; but not so as perfectly to equal the Velocity of the
first Motion impress'd on, and still conserv'd by the superficial Parts
of the Globe.</p>

<p>As to the quantity of this Motion it is almost impossible to define
it, both from the Nature of this kind of Observation, which cannot be
very accurately perform'd, as also from the small time these Variations
have been observ'd, and their Change discover'd. It appears by all
Circumstances, that its Period is of many Centuries of Years, and as far
as may be collected from the Change of the Place, where there was no
Variation, by reason of the Equilibre of the two Southern Magnetical
Poles, <i>viz.</i> from <i>Cape d' Agulhas</i> to the Meridian of St.
<i>Helena</i> (which is about 23 <i>degr.</i> in about ninety Years) and
of the place where the Westerly Variation is in its
<span title="akmê">ἀκμὴ</span>
or greatest Deflection, being about half so much, <i>viz.</i> from the
Isle of <i>Diego Roiz</i> to the South West Parts of <i>Madagascar</i>.
We may with some Reason conjecture, that the <i>American</i> Pole has
mov'd Westwards forty six Degrees in that time, and that the whole
Period thereof is perform'd in seven hundred Years, or thereabouts; so
that the nice Determination of this, and of several other Particulars in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
Magnetick System is reserv'd for remote Posterity; all that we can hope
to do, is to leave behind us Observations that may be confided in, and
to propose an Hypothesis which after Ages may examine, amend or refute.
Only here I must take leave to recommend to all Masters of Ships, and
all others, Lovers of Natural Truths, that they use their utmost
Diligence to make, or procure to be made, Observations of these
Variations in all parts of the World, as well in the North as South
Latitude (after the laudable Custom of our <i>East India</i> Commanders)
and that they please to communicate them to the <i>Royal Society</i>, in
order to leave as compleat a History as may be to those that are
hereafter to compare all together, and to compleat and perfect this
abstruse Theory.</p>

<p>And by the way it will not be amiss to amend a receiv'd Error in the
Practice of observing the Variation, which is, to take it by the
Amplitude of the Rising and Setting Sun, when his Center appears in the
visible Horizon; whereas he ought to be observ'd when his under Limb is
still above the Horizon about ⅔ of his Diameter, or twenty Minutes, upon
the score of the Refraction, and the height of the Eye of the Observer
above the Surface of the Sea: Or else they are to work the Amplitudes as
they do the Azimuth, reckoning the Suns Distance from the Zenith 90°
36': This, though it be of little consequence near the Æquinoctial, will
make a great Error in high Latitudes, where the Sun rises and sets
obliquely.</p>

<p>But to return to our Hypothesis, In order to explain the Change of
the Variations, we have adventur'd to make the Earth hollow, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
place another Globe within it; and I doubt not but this will find
Opposers enough. I know 'twill be Objected, That there is no Instance in
Nature of the like thing; that if there was such a middle Globe it would
not keep its place in the Center, but be apt to deviate therefrom, and
might possibly chock against the Concave Shell, to the ruin, or at least
endammaging thereof; That the Water of the Sea would perpetually leak
through, unless we suppose the Cavity full of Water; That were it
possible, yet it does not appear of what use such an inward Sphere can
be of, being shut up in Eternal Darkness, and therefore unfit for the
Production of Animals or Plants; with many more Objections, according to
the Fate of all such new Propositions.</p>

<p>To these, and all other that I can foresee, I briefly Answer, That
the Ring environing the Globe of <i>Saturn</i> is a notable Instance of
this kind, as having the same common Center, and moving along with the
Planet, without sensibly approaching him on one side more than the
other. And if this Ring were turn'd on one of its Diameters, it would
then describe such a Concave Sphere as I suppose our External one to be.
And since the Ring, in any Position given, would, in the same manner,
keep the Centre of <i>Saturn</i> in its own, it follows, that such a
Concave Sphere may move with another included in it, having the same
common Centre. Nor can it well be suppos'd otherwise, considering the
Nature of Gravity; for should these Globes be adjusted once to the same
common Centre, the Gravity of the parts of the Concave would press
equally towards the Centre of the inner Ball, which equality must
necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
continue till some External Force disturb it, which is not easie to
imagine in our Case. This perhaps I might more intelligibly express, by
saying that the inner Globe being posited in the Centre of the
Exteriour, must necessarily ascend which way soever it move; that is, it
must overcome the force of Gravity pressing towards the common Centre,
by an impulse it must receive from some outward Agent; but all outward
Efforts being sufficiently fenc'd against by the Shell that surrounds
it, it follows, that this <i>Nucleus</i> being once fixt in the common
Centre, must always there remain.</p>

<p>As to the leaking of the Water through this Shell, when once a
passage shall be found for it to run through, I must confess it is an
Objection seemingly of weight; but when we consider how tightly great
Beds of Chalk or Clay, and much more Stone do hold Water, and even Caves
arch'd with Sand; no Man can doubt but the Wisdom of the Creator has
provided for the Macrocosm by many more ways than I can either imagine
or express, especially since we see the admirable and innumerable
Contrivances wherewith each worthless Individual is furnish'd both to
defend it self, and propagate its Species. What Curiosity in the
Structure, what Accuracy in the Mixture and Composition of the parts,
ought not we to expect in the Fabrick of this Globe, made to be the
lasting Habitation of so many various Species of Animals, in each of
which there want not many Instances that manifest the boundless Power
and Goodness of their Divine Author; and can we then think it a hard
Supposition, that the Internal Parts of this Bubble of Earth should be
replete with such Saline and Vitriolick Particles as may contribute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
to Petrefaction, and dispose the transuding Water to shoot and coagulate
into Stone, so as continually to fortifie, and, if need were, to
consolidate any breach or flaw in the Concave Surface of the Shell.</p>

<p>And this perhaps may not without Reason be suppos'd to be the final
Cause of the admixture of the Magnetical Matter in the Mass of the
Terrestrial parts of our Globe, <i>viz.</i> To make good and maintain
the Concave Arch of this Shell: For by what the Excellent Mr.
<i>Newton</i> has shewn in his <i>Principia Philosophiæ</i>, it will
follow, that according to the general Principle of Gravity, visible
throughout the whole Universe, all those Particles that by length of
time, or otherwise, shall moulder away, or become loose on the Concave
Surface of the External Sphere, would fall in, and with great force
descend on the Internal, unless those Particles were of another sort of
Matter capable by their stronger tendency to each other, to suspend the
force of Gravity; but we know no other Substances capable of supporting
each other by their mutual Attraction but the Magnetical, and these we
see miraculously to perform that Office, even where the Power of Gravity
has its full effect, much more within the Globe where it is weaker. Why
then may we not suppose these said Arches to be lin'd throughout with a
Magnetical Matter, or rather to be one great Concave Magnet, whose two
Poles are the Poles we have before observ'd to be fixt in the Surface of
our Globe.</p>

<p>Another Argument, favouring this Hypothesis, is drawn from a
Proposition of the same Mr. <i>Newton</i>, where he determines the force
wherewith the <i>Moon</i> moves the <i>Sea</i> in producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
the <i>Tides</i>: His Words are, <i>Densitas Lunæ est ad densitatem
Terra ut 680 ad 387 seu 9 ad 5 quamproximé. Est igitur corpus Lunæ
densius ac magis terrestre quam Terra nostra</i>, p. 466. Now if the
Moon be more solid than the Earth, as 9 to 5, why may we not reasonably
suppose the Moon, being a small Body, and a secondary Planet, to be
solid Earth, Water, Stone, and this Globe to consist of the same
Materials, only four Ninths thereof to be Cavity, within and between the
Internal Spheres; which I would render not improbable.</p>

<p>To those that shall enquire of what use these included Globes can be,
it must be allow'd, that they can be of very little service to the
Inhabitants of this outward World, nor can the Sun be serviceable to
them, either with his Light or Heat. But since it is now taken for
granted, that the Earth is one of the Planets, and they all are with
Reason suppos'd Habitable, though we are not able to define by what sort
of Animals; and since we see all the parts of the Creation abound with
Animate Beings, as the Air with Birds and Flies, the Water with the
numerous varieties of Fish, and the very Earth with Reptiles of so many
sorts; all whose ways of Living would be to us incredible did not daily
Experience teach us. Why then should we think it strange that the
prodigious Mass of Matter, whereof this Globe does consist, should be
capable of some other improvement than barely to serve to support its
Surface? Why may not we rather suppose that the exceeding small quantity
of solid Matter, in respect of the fluid Æther, is so dispos'd by the
Almighty Wisdom, as to yield as great a Surface for the use of living
Creatures, as can consist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
with the conveniency and security of the whole? We our selves, in Cities
where we are pressed for Room, commonly build many Stories one over the
other, and thereby accommodate a much greater multitude of
Inhabitants.</p>

<p>But still it will be said, That without Light there can be no living,
and therefore all this <i>apparatus</i> of our inward Globes must be
useless: To this I Answer, That there are many ways of producing Light
which we are wholly ignorant of; the Medium it self may be always
luminous after the manner of our <i>Ignes fatui</i>. The Concave Arches
may in several places shine with such a Substance as invests the Surface
of the Sun; nor can we, without a boldness unbecoming a Philosopher,
adventure to assert the impossibility of peculiar Luminaries below, of
which we have no sort of <i>Idea</i>. I am sure the Poets <i>Virgil</i>
and <i>Claudian</i> have gone before me in this Thought, inlightning
their <i>Elysian Fields</i> with Sun and Stars proper to those infernal,
or rather internal Regions. <i>Virg. Æneid. 6.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-center">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">Largior hic compos Æther &amp; lumine vestit</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">And though this be not to be esteem'd as an Argument,
yet I may take the liberty I see others do, to quote the Poets when it
makes for my purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
Lastly, To explain yet farther what I mean, I have adventur'd to adjoin
the following Scheme, (<i>Tab. 1. Fig. 3</i>) wherein the Earth is
represented by the outward Circle, and the three inward Circles are made
nearly proportionable to the Magnitudes of the Planets <i>Venus</i>,
<i>Mars</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, all which may be included within the
Globe of Earth, and all the Arches more than sufficiently strong to bear
their weight. The Concave of each Arch, which is shaded differently from
the rest, I suppose to be made up of Magnetical Matter; and the whole to
turn about the same common Axis <i>pp</i>, only with this difference,
that the Outer Sphere still moves somewhat faster than the Inner. Thus
the Diameter of the Earth being about eight thousand <i>English</i>
Miles, I allow five hundred Miles for the thickness of its Shell, and
another space of five hundred Miles for a Medium between, capable of an
immense Atmosphere for the use of the Globe of <i>Venus</i>:
<i>Venus</i> again I give a Shell of the same thickness, and leave as
great a space between her Concave and <i>Mars</i>; so likewise from
<i>Mars</i> to <i>Mercury</i>, which latter Ball we will suppose solid,
and about two thousand Miles Diameter. Thus I have shew'd a possibility
of a much more ample Creation, than has hitherto been imagin'd; and if
this seem strange to those that are unacquainted with the Magnetical
System, it is hop'd that all such will endeavour, first, to inform
themselves of the Matter of Fact, and then try if they can find out a
more simple Hypothesis, at least a less absurd, even in their own
Opinions. And whereas I have adventur'd to make these Subterraneous Orbs
capable of being Inhabited, 'twas done designedly for the sake of those
who will be apt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
to ask <i>cui bono</i>, and with whom Arguments drawn from <i>Final
Causes</i> prevail much. If this short Essay shall find a kind
Acceptance, I shall be encourag'd to enquire farther, and to Polish this
rough Draft of a Notion till hitherto not so much as started in the
World, and of which we could have no Intimation from any other of the
<i>Phænomena</i> of Nature.</p>

<p>Since this was written, a Discovery I have made in the Cœlestial
Motions, seems to render a farther Account of the Use of the Cavity of
the Earth, <i>viz.</i> To diminish the Specifick Gravity thereof, in
respect of the Moon; for I think I can demonstrate that the Opposition
of the Æther to the Motions of the Planets in long time becomes
sensible; and consequently the greater Body must receive a less
Opposition than the smaller, unless the Specifick Gravity of the smaller
do proportionably exceed that of the greater, in which case only they
can move together; so that the Cavity I assign in the Earth, may well
serve to adjust its weight to that of the Moon, for otherwise the Earth
would leave the Moon behind it, and she become another Primary
Planet.</p>

<h3>An Historical Account of the <strong>Trade Winds</strong> and
<strong>Monsoons</strong>, observable in the Seas between and near the
<strong>Tropicks</strong>, with an attempt to assign the Physical Cause
of the said Winds, by Mr. <strong>Ed. Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">AN exact Relation of the constant and periodical
Winds, observable in several Tracts of the Ocean, is a part of Natural
History not less desireable and useful, than it is difficult to obtain,
and its <i>Phænomena</i> hard to explicate: I am not ignorant that
several Writers have undertaken this Subject, and although
<i>Varenius</i> (<i>Lib. 1. Chap. 21. Geo. Gen.</i>) seems to have
endeavour'd after the best information from <i>Voyagers</i>, yet cannot
his Accounts be admitted for accurate, by those that shall attentively
consider and compare them together, and some of them are most evident
Mistakes; which, as near as I can, I shall attempt to rectify, having
had the opportunity of conversing with Navigators, acquainted with all
parts of <i>India</i>, and having liv'd a considerable time between the
<i>Tropicks</i>, and there made my own Remarks.</p>

<p>The Substance of what I have collected is briefly as follows.</p>

<p>The Universal <i>Ocean</i> may most properly be divided into three
Parts, <i>viz.</i> 1. The <i>Atlantick</i> and <i>Æthiopick-Sea</i>.
2. The <i>Indian Ocean</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
3. The Great <i>South Sea</i>, or the <i>Pacifick Ocean</i>; and though
these Seas do all communicate by the South, yet as to our present
purpose of the <i>Trade Winds</i>, they are sufficiently separated by
the interposition of great Tracts of <i>Land</i>; the first lying
between <i>Africa</i> and <i>America</i>, the second between
<i>Africa</i> and the <i>Indian Islands</i>, and <i>Hollandia Nova</i>;
and the last between the <i>Phillipine Isles</i>, <i>China</i>,
<i>Japan</i> and <i>Hollandia Nova</i> on the <i>West</i>, and the Coast
of <i>America</i> on the <i>East</i>. Now following this natural
division of the Seas, so will we divide our History into three parts in
the same order.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I. In the <i>Atlantick</i> and <i>Æthiopick</i>
Seas between the <i>Tropicks</i>, there is a general <i>Easterly
Wind</i> all the Year long, without any considerable Variation,
excepting that it is subject to be deflected therefrom, some few Points
of the Compass towards the <i>North</i> or <i>South</i>, according to
the Position of the place. The Observations which have been made of
these Deflections, are the following.</p>

<p>1. That near the Coast of <i>Africa</i>, as soon as you have pass'd
the <i>Canary Isles</i>, you are sure to meet a fresh Gale of <i>North
East</i> Wind, about the Latitude of 28 Degrees <i>North</i>, which
seldom comes to the <i>Eastwards</i> of the <i>East North-East</i>, or
passes the <i>North North-East</i>. This Wind accompanies those bound to
the Southward, to the Latitude of ten North, and about a hundred Leagues
from the <i>Guinea</i> Coast, where, till the fourth Degree of North
Latitude, they fall into the Calms and Tornadoes; of which more
hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
2. That those bound to the <i>Caribbee Isles</i>, find, as they approach
the <i>American</i> side, that the aforesaid <i>North-East</i> Wind
becomes still more and more Easterly, so as sometimes to be <i>East</i>,
sometimes <i>East</i> by <i>South</i>, but yet most commonly to the
<i>Northward</i> of the <i>East</i> a Point or two, seldom more. 'Tis
likewise observ'd, that the strength of these Winds does gradually
decrease, as you sail to the <i>Westwards</i>.</p>

<p>3. That the limits of the Trade and variable Winds, in this Ocean,
are farther extended on the <i>American</i> side than the
<i>African</i>; for whereas you meet not with this certain Wind till
after you have pass'd the Latitude of twenty eight Degrees on this side;
on the <i>American</i> side it commonly holds to thirty, thirty one, or
thirty two Degrees of Latitude; and this is verified likewise to the
Southwards of the Æquinoctial, for near the <i>Cape</i> of
<i>Good-Hope</i> the limits of the Trade Winds, are three or four
Degrees nearer the Line, than on the Coast of <i>Brazile</i>.</p>

<p>4. That from the Latitude of four Degrees <i>North</i>, to the
aforesaid Limits on the <i>South</i> of the Æquator, the Winds are
generally and perpetually between the <i>South</i> and <i>East</i>, and
most commonly between the <i>South-East</i> and <i>East</i>, observing
always this Rule, That on the <i>African</i> side they are more
<i>Southerly</i>, on the <i>Brazilian</i> more <i>Easterly</i>, so as to
become almost due <i>East</i>, the little deflection they have being
still to the <i>Southwards</i>. In this part of the Ocean it has been my
fortune to pass a full Year, in an Employment that oblig'd me to regard
more than ordinary the Weather, and I found the Winds constantly about
the <i>South-East</i>, the most usual Point <i>S E b E</i>; when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
was Easterly, it generally blew hard, and was gloomy, dark, and
sometimes rainy Weather; if it came to the Southwards it was generally
Serene, and a small Gale next to a Calm, but this not very common. But I
never saw it to the Westwards of the South, or Northwards of the
East.</p>

<p>5. That the Season of the Year has some small effect on these Trade
Winds, for that when the Sun is considerable to the Northwards of the
Æquator, the South-East Winds, especially in the Straight of this Ocean
(if I may so call it) between <i>Brazile</i> and the Coast of
<i>Guinea</i>, do vary a Point or two to the Southwards, and the
North-East become more Easterly; and on the contrary, when the Sun is
towards the Tropick of <i>Capricorn</i> the South-Easterly Winds become
more Easterly, and the North-Easterly Winds on this side the Line veere
more to the Northwards.</p>

<p>6. That as there is no general Rule that admits not of some
Exception, so there is in this Ocean a Tract of Sea wherein the
Southerly and South-West Winds are perpetual, <i>viz.</i> all along the
Coast of <i>Guinea</i>, for above five hundred Leagues together, from
<i>Sierra Leona</i> to the Isle of St. <i>Thomas</i>; for the South-East
Trade Wind having pass'd the Line, and approaching the Coast of
<i>Guinea</i> within eighty or 100 Leagues, inclines towards the Shore,
and becomes S. S. E. and by Degrees, as you come nearer, it veeres about
to South, S. S. W. and in with the Land South-West, and sometimes West
South-West; which Variation is better express'd in the Mapp hereto
annexed, (<i>Vide Plate 2</i>) than it can well be in Words. These are
the Winds which are observ'd on this Coast when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
blows true, but there are frequent Calms, violent sudden Gusts call'd
<i>Tornado's</i>, from all Points of the Compass, and sometimes
unwholsome foggy Easterly Winds, call'd <i>Hermitaa</i> by the Natives,
which too often infest the Navigation of these parts.</p>

<p>7. That to the Northwards of the Line, between four and ten Degrees
of Latitude, and between the Meridians of <i>Cape Virde</i>, and of the
Eastermost Islands that bear that Name, there is a Tract of Sea wherein
it were improper to say there is any Trade Wind, or yet a Variable; for
it seems condemn'd to perpetual Calms, attended with terrible Thunder
and Lightning, and Rains so frequent, that our Navigators from thence
call this part of the Sea the <i>Rains</i>; the little Winds that are,
be only some sudden uncertain Gusts, of very little Continuance and less
Extent; so that sometimes each Hour you shall have a different Gale,
which dies away into a Calm before another succeed, and in a Fleet of
Ships in sight of one another, each shall have the Wind from a several
Point of the Compass; with these weak <i>Breezes</i> Ships are oblig'd
to make the best of their way to the Southward through the aforesaid six
Degrees, wherein 'tis reported some have been detain'd whole Months for
want of Wind.</p>

<p>From the three last Observables is shewn the Reason of two notable
Occurents in the <i>East-India</i> and <i>Guinea</i> Navigations: The
one is, why, notwithstanding the narrowest part of the Sea between
<i>Guinea</i> and <i>Brazile</i> be about five hundred Leagues over, yet
Ships bound to the Southward, sometimes, especially in the Months of
<i>July</i> and <i>August</i>, find a great difficulty to pass it. This
happens because of the South-East
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
Winds, at that time of the Year commonly extending some Degrees beyond
the ordinary limit of four Degrees North Latitude, and withal they come
so much Southerly, as to be sometimes South, sometimes a Point or two to
the West; there remains then only to ply to Windward, and if on the one
side they stand away W. S. W. they gain the Wind still more and more
Easterly; but there is danger of not weathering the <i>Brazilian</i>
Shoar, or at least the Shoals upon that Coast. But if upon the other
Tack they go away E. S. E. they fall into the Neighbourhood of the Coast
of <i>Guinea</i>, from which there is no departing without running
Easterly, as far as the Isle of St. <i>Thomas</i>, which is the constant
practice of all the <i>Guinea</i> Ships, and which may seem very
strange, without the consideration of the sixth Remark, which shews the
Reason of it: For being in with the Coast, the Wind blows generally at
S. W. and W. S. W. with which Winds they cannot go to the Northward for
the Land; and on the other Tack they can lie no nearer the Wind than S.
S. E. or South; with these Courses they run off the Shoar, but in so
doing they always find the Winds more and more contrary; so that when
near the Shoar they could lie South, at a greater distance they can make
their way no better than S. E. and afterwards E. S. E. with which
Courses they fetch commonly the Isle of St. <i>Thomas</i> and Cape
<i>Lopez</i>, where finding the Winds to the Eastward of the South, they
keep them favourable, by running away to the Westward in the South
Latitude, of three or four Degrees, where the S. E. Winds are
perpetual.</p>

<p>For the sake of these general Winds, all those that use the
<i>West-Indian</i> Trade, even those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
bound to <i>Virginia</i>, count it their best Course to get as soon as
they can to the Southwards, that so they may be certain of a fair and
fresh Gale to run before it to the Westwards; and for the same Reason
those homewards bound from <i>America</i>, endeavour to gain the
Latitude of thirty Degrees, as soon as possible, where they first find
the Winds begin to be variable; tho' the most ordinary Winds in the
Northern part of the <i>Atlantick</i> Ocean come from between the South
and West.</p>

<p>As to those furious Storms call'd <i>Hurricanes</i>, which are, as it
were, peculiar to the <i>Caribbee</i> Isles; and which so dreadfully
afflict them in the Month of <i>August</i>, or not much before or after,
they do not so properly belong to this place, both by Reason of their
small continuance and extent, as likewise because they are not
Anniversary, some Years having more than one, and sometimes for several
Years together there being none at all. But their Violence is so
unconceivable, and their other <i>Phænomena</i> so surprising, that they
merit well to be consider'd apart.</p>

<p>What is here said, is to be understood of the Sea Winds at some
distance from the Land; for upon and near the Shoars, the Land and Sea
Breezes are almost every where sensible; and the great Variety which
happens in their Periods, Force and Direction, from the situation of the
Mountains, Vallies and Woods, and from the various Texture of the Soil,
more or less capable of retaining and reflecting Heat, and of exhaling
or condensing Vapours, is such, that it were an endless task, to
endeavour to account for them.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
II. In the <i>Indian</i> Ocean, the Winds are partly general, as in the
<i>Æthiopick</i> Ocean, partly Periodical; that is, half the Year they
blow one way, and the other half near upon the opposite Points; and
these Points and Times of shifting are different in different parts of
this Ocean; the limits of each Tract of Sea, subject to the same Change
or <i>Monsoon</i>, are certainly very hard to determine, but the
diligence I have used to be rightly inform'd, and the care I have taken
therein, has, in a great measure, surmounted that Difficulty; and I am
perswaded that the following Particulars may be relied upon.</p>

<p>1. That between the Latitudes of ten Degrees and thirty Degrees
South, between <i>Madagascar</i> and <i>Hollandia Nova</i>, the general
Trade Wind about the S. E. by E. is found to blow all the Year long, to
all Intents and Purposes after the same manner as in the same Latitudes
in the <i>Æthiopick</i> Ocean, as it is describ'd in the fourth
<i>Remark</i> aforegoing.</p>

<p>2. That the aforesaid S. E. Winds extend to within two Degrees of the
<i>Æquator</i>, during the Months of <i>June</i>, <i>July</i>,
<i>August</i>, &amp;c. to <i>November</i>; at which time between the
<i>South Latitudes</i> of three and ten Degrees, being near the Meridian
of the North end of <i>Madagascar</i>, and between two and twelve South
Latitude, being near <i>Sumatra</i> and <i>Java</i>, the contrary Winds
from the N. W. or between the North and West, set in and blow for half
the Year, <i>viz.</i> from the beginning of <i>December</i> till
<i>May</i>; and this <i>Monsoon</i> is observ'd as far as the
<i>Molucca</i> Isles, of which more anon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
3. That to the Northward of three Degrees South Latitude, over the whole
<i>Arabian</i> or <i>Indian-Sea</i> and Gulph of <i>Bengall</i>, from
<i>Sumatra</i> to the Coast of <i>Africa</i>, there is another
<i>Monsoon</i>, blowing from <i>October</i> to <i>April</i> upon the
North East Points; but in the other half Year, from <i>April</i> to
<i>October</i>, upon the opposite Points of S. W. and W. S. W. and that
with rather more force than the other, accompanied with dark rainy
Weather, whereas the N. E. blows clear; 'tis likewise to be noted, that
the Winds are not so constant, either in strength or point in the Gulph
of <i>Bengall</i>, as they are in the <i>Indian-Sea</i>, where a certain
and steady Gale scarce ever fails. 'Tis also remarkable, that the S. W.
Winds in these Seas are generally more Southerly on the <i>African</i>
side, more Westerly on the <i>Indian</i>.</p>

<p>4. That as an <i>Appendix</i> to the last describ'd <i>Monsoon</i>,
there is a Tract of Sea to the Southwards of the Æquator, subject to the
same Changes of the Winds, <i>viz.</i> near the <i>African</i> Coast,
between it and the Island <i>Madagascar</i> or St. <i>Lawrence</i>, and
from thence Northwards as far as the Line; wherein from <i>April</i> to
<i>October</i> there is found a constant fresh S. S. W. Wind, which, as
you go more Northerly, becomes still more and more Westerly, so as to
fall in with the W. S. W. Winds, mention'd before, in those Months of
the Year to be certain to the Northward of the Æquator: What Winds blow
in these Seas, for the other half Year, from <i>October</i> to
<i>April</i>, I have not yet been able to obtain to my full
satisfaction, for that our Navigators always return from <i>India</i>
without <i>Madagascar</i>, and so are little acquainted in this Matter;
the Account that has been given me is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
only this, that the Winds are much Easterly hereabouts, and as often to
the North of the true East as to the Southwards thereof.</p>

<p>5. That to the Eastward of <i>Sumatra</i> and <i>Malacca</i>, to the
Northwards of the Line, and along the Coast of <i>Cambodia</i> and
<i>China</i>, the <i>Monsoons</i> blow North and South, that is to say,
the N. E. Winds are much Northerly, and the S. W. much Southerly: This
Constitution reaches to the Eastwards of the <i>Philippine</i> Isles,
and as far Northerly as <i>Japan</i>. The Northern <i>Monsoon</i>
setting in, in these Seas, in <i>October</i> or <i>November</i>, and the
Southern in <i>May</i>, blowing all the Summer Months: Here it is to be
noted, That the Points of the Compass, from whence the Wind comes in
these Parts of the World, are not so fixt as in those lately describ'd;
for the Southerly will frequently pass a Point or two to the Eastwards
of the South, and the Northerly as much to the Westwards of the North,
which seems occasion'd by the great quantity of Land, which is
interspers'd in these Seas.</p>

<p>6. That in the same <i>Meridians</i>, but to the Southwards of the
Æquator, being that Tract lying between <i>Sumatra</i> and <i>Java</i>
to the West, and <i>New Guinea</i> to the East, the same Northerly
<i>Monsoons</i> are observ'd, but with this difference, that the
inclination of the Northerly is towards the N. West, and of the
Southerly towards the S. E. but the <i>plagæ venti</i> are not more
constant here than in the former, <i>viz.</i> variable five or six
Points; besides the times of the Change of these Winds, are not the same
as in the <i>Chinese</i> Seas, but about a Month or six Weeks later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
7. That these contrary Winds do not shift all at once, but in some
places the time of the Change is attended with Calms, in others with
variable Winds; and it is particularly remarkable, that the end of the
Westerly <i>Monsoon</i> on the Coast of <i>Coromandel</i>, and the two
last Months of the Southerly <i>Monsoon</i> in the Seas of <i>China</i>,
are very subject to be tempestuous: The violence of these Storms is
such, that they seem to be of the Nature of the <i>West-India
Hurricanes</i>, and render the Navigation of these parts very unsafe
about that time of the Year. These Tempests are by our Seamen usually
term'd, <i>The breaking up of the Monsoons</i>.</p>

<p>By reason of the shifting of these Winds, all those that sail in
these Seas, are oblig'd to observe the Seasons proper for their Voyages,
and so doing they fail not of a fair Wind and speedy Passage; but if so
be they chance to out-stay their time, till the contrary <i>Monsoon</i>
sets in, as it frequently happens, they are forc'd to give over the
hopes of accomplishing their intended Voyages, and either return to the
Port from whence they came, or else put in to some other Harbour, there
to spend the time till the Winds shall come favourable.</p>

<p class="gap-above">III. The third Ocean call'd <i>Mare Pacificum</i>,
whose Extent is equal to that of the other two (it being from the West
Coast of <i>America</i> to the <i>Philippine</i> Islands, not less than
150 Degrees of Longitude) is that which is least known to our own or the
Neighbour Nations; that Navigation that there is on it, is by the
<i>Spaniards</i>, who go Yearly from the Coast of <i>New Spain</i> to
the <i>Manilha's</i>, but that but by one beaten track; so that I cannot
be so particular here as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
other two. What the <i>Spanish</i> Authors say of the Winds they find in
their Courses, and what is confirm'd by the old Accounts of <i>Drake</i>
and <i>Cavendish</i>; and since by <i>Schooten</i>, who sail'd the whole
breadth of this Sea in the Southern Latitude of fifteen or sixteen
Degrees, is, that there is a great conformity between the Winds of this
Sea, and those of the <i>Atlantick</i> and <i>Æthiopick</i>; that is to
say, that to the Northwards of the Æquator, the predominant Wind is
between the East and North-East; and to the Southwards thereof there is
a constant steady Gale between the East and South-East, and that on both
sides the Line with so much constancy, that they scarce ever need to
attend the Sails, and Strength, that it is rare to fail of crossing this
vast Ocean in ten Weeks time, which is about 130 Miles <i>per diem</i>;
besides, 'tis said that Storms and Tempests are never known in these
parts: So that here is the very best of Sailing; no want of a fresh fair
Wind, and yet no danger of having too much: Wherefore some have thought
it might be as short a Voyage to <i>Japan</i> and <i>China</i>, to go by
the Streights of <i>Magellan</i>, as by the <i>Cape</i> of <i>Good
Hope</i>.</p>

<p>The Limits of these general Winds are also much the same as in the
<i>Atlantick</i> Sea, <i>viz.</i> about the thirtieth Degree of Latitude
on both sides; for the <i>Spaniards</i> homewards bound from the
<i>Manilha's</i>, always take the advantage of the Southerly
<i>Monsoon</i>, blowing there in the Summer Months, and run up to the
Northwards of that Latitude, as high as <i>Japan</i>, before they meet
with variable Winds, to shape their Course to the Eastwards. And
<i>Schooten</i> and others that have gone about by the <i>Magellan</i>
Streights, have found the Limits of S. E.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
Winds, much about the same Latitude to the Southwards; besides a farther
<i>Analogy</i> between the Winds of this Ocean, and the
<i>Æthiopick</i>, appears in that, upon the Coast of <i>Peru</i>, they
are always much Southerly, like as they are found near the Shoars of
<i>Angola</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">Thus far Matter of Fact, wherein if the information
I have receiv'd be not in all parts Accurate, it has not been for want
of inquiry from those I conceiv'd best able to instruct me; and I shall
take it for a very great Kindness if any Master of a Ship, or other
Person, well inform'd of the Nature of the Winds, in any of the
aforemention'd parts of the World, shall please to communicate their
Observations thereupon; so that what I have here Collected may be either
confirm'd or amended, or by the addition of some material Circumstances
enlarg'd. It is not the work of one, nor of few, but of a multitude of
Observers, to bring together the Experience requisite to compose a
perfect and compleat History of these Winds; however I am not much
doubtful that I have err'd in, or omitted any of the principal
Observables, whatever lesser Particulars may have escaped my
Knowledge.</p>

<p>To help the Conception of the Reader in a manner of so much
difficulty, I believ'd it necessary to adjoin a Scheme, (<i>Plate
2.</i>) shewing at one view all the various Tracts and Courses of these
Winds; whereby 'tis possible the thing may be better understood, than by
any verbal Description whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Limits of these several Tracts are design'd every where by prickt
Lines, as well in the <i>Atlantick</i> and <i>Æthiopick</i>, where they
are the boundaries of the Trade and variable Winds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
as in the <i>Indian</i> Ocean, where they also shew the Extent of the
several <i>Monsoons</i>. I could think of no better way to design the
Course of the Winds on the Map, than by drawing rows of stroaks in the
same Line that a Ship would move going always before it; the sharp end
of each little stroak pointing out that part of the Horizon, from whence
the Wind continually comes; and where there are <i>Monsoons</i>, the
rows of the stroaks run alternately backwards and forwards, by which
means they are thicker there than elsewhere. As to the great South Sea,
considering its vast Extent, and the little Variety there is in its
Winds, and the great <i>Analogy</i> between them, and those of the
<i>Atlantick</i> and <i>Æthiopick</i> Oceans; besides, that the greatest
part thereof is wholly unknown to us; I thought it unnecessary to
lengthen the Map therewith.</p>

<p>In the foregoing History are contained several Problems, that merit
well the Consideration of our acutest Naturalists, both by reason of the
constancy of the Effect, and of the immense Extent thereof; near half
the Surface of the Globe being concerned. The chief of these Problems
are, 1. Why these Winds are perpetually from the East in the
<i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Æthiopick</i>; as likewise in the <i>Pacifick</i>
Ocean, between the Latitudes of 30 North and South? 2. Why the said
Winds extend no farther with constancy than to the Latitude of 30
Degrees? 3. Why there should be a constant South-Westerly Wind upon and
near the Coast of <i>Guinea</i>? 4. Why in the North part of the
<i>Indian</i> Ocean, the Winds, which for one half Year do agree with
those of the other two Oceans, should change in other half Year, and
blow from the opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
Points; whilst the Southern part of that Ocean follows the General Rule,
and has perpetual Winds about S. E? 5. Why in these General Trade-Winds
it should be always true, that to the Northward of the <i>Æquator</i> it
is inclin'd to the Northwards of the East; and in South Latitudes, to
the Southward thereof? 6. Why in these Seas of <i>China</i> there should
be so great an Inclination from the East to the North, more than
elsewhere? with many more, which it would be much easier to propose than
answer.</p>

<p>But lest I should seem to propose to others, Difficulties which I
have not thought worth my own Time and Pains, take here the result of an
earnest Endeavour after the true reason of the aforesaid
<i>Phænomena</i>; wherein if I am not able to account for all
Particulars, yet 'tis hoped the Thoughts I have spent thereon, will not
be judged wholly lost, by the Curious in Natural Enquiries.</p>

<p>Wind is most properly defined to be the Stream or Current of the Air,
and where such a Current is perpetual and fixt in its Course, 'tis
necessary that it proceed from a permanent un-intermitting Cause.
Wherefore some have been inclin'd to propose the diurnal <i>Rotation</i>
of the Earth upon its <i>Axis</i>, by which, as the <i>Globe</i> turns
Eastwards, the loose and <i>fluid</i> Particles of the Air, being so
exceeding light as they be, are left behind, so that in respect of the
Earths <i>Surface</i> they move Westwards, and become a constant
Easterly Wind. This Opinion seems confirm'd, for that these Winds are
found only near the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, in those Parallels of Latitude
where the diurnal Motion is swiftest; and I should readily assent to it,
if the constant Calms in the <i>Atlantick</i> Sea, near the
<i>Æquator</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
the Westerly Winds near the Coast of <i>Guinea</i>; and the
<i>Periodical</i> Westerly <i>Monsoons</i> under the <i>Æquator</i> in
the <i>Indian</i> Seas, did not declare the insufficency of that
<i>Hypothesis</i>. Besides the Air being kept to the Earth by the
Principle of <i>Gravity</i>, would acquire the same degree of
<i>Velocity</i> that the Earths <i>Surface</i> moves with, as well in
respect of the diurnal <i>Rotation</i>, as of the Annual about the Sun,
which is about thirty times swifter.</p>

<p>It remains therefore to substitute some other Cause, capable of
producing a like constant Effect, not liable to the same Objections, but
agreeable to the known Properties of the Elements of Air and Water, and
the Laws of the Motion of fluid Bodies. Such an one is, I conceive, the
Action of the Sun Beams upon the Air and Water, as he passes every Day
over the Oceans, consider'd together with the Nature of the Soil, and
Situation of the adjoining Continents: I say therefore, first, that
according to the Laws of <i>Staticks</i>, the Air which is less rarified
or expanded by heat, and consequently more ponderous, must have a Motion
towards those parts thereof, which are more rarified, and less
ponderous, to bring it to an <i>Æquilibrium</i>; and secondly, That the
Presence of the Sun continually shifting to the Westwards, that part
towards which the Air tends, by reason of the Rarifaction made by his
greatest <i>Meridian</i> Heat, is with him carried Westward, and
consequently the tendency of the whole Body of the lower Air is that
way.</p>

<p>Thus a general Easterly Wind is formed, which being impressed upon
all the Air of a vast Ocean, the Parts impel one the other, and so keep
moving till the next return of the Sun,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
whereby so much of the Motion as was lost, is again restored, and thus
the Westerly Wind is made perpetual.</p>

<p>From the same Principle it follows, that this Easterly Wind should on
the North side of the <i>Æquator</i>, be to the Northwards of the East,
and in South Latitudes to the Southwards thereof; for near the
<i>Line</i>, the Air is much more rarified, than at a greater distance
from it; because of the Sun twice in a Year Vertical, and at no time
distant above 23 Degr. and a half; at which distance the Heat, being as
the Sine of the Angle of Incidence, is but little short of that of the
perpendicular Ray. Whereas under the Tropicks, though the Sun stay long
Vertical, yet he is as long 47 Degr. off; which is a kind of Winter,
wherein the Air so cools, as that the Summer-heat cannot warm it to the
same degree with that under the Æquator. Wherefore the Air to the
Northwards and Southwards, being less rarified than that in the middle,
it follows, that from both sides it ought to tend towards the Æquator:
This Motion compounded with the former Easterly Wind, answers all the
<i>Phænomena</i> of the general Trade-winds; which, if the whole Surface
of the Globe were Sea, would undoubtedly blow all round the World, as
they are found to do in the <i>Atlantick</i>, and <i>Æthiopick</i>
Oceans.</p>

<p>But seeing that so great Continents do interpose, and break the
continuity of the Oceans, regard must be had to the Nature of the Soil,
and the Position of the high Mountains, which I suppose the two
principal Causes of the several Variations of the Winds, from the former
general Rule: For if a Country lying near the Sun, prove to be flat,
sandy, low Land, such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
as the Desarts of <i>Lybia</i> are usually reported to be, the Heat
occasion'd by the Reflection of the Suns Beams, and the retention
thereof in the Sand, is incredible to those that have not felt it;
whereby the Air being exceedingly rarified, it is necessary that the
cooler and more dense Air should run thitherwards to restore the
<i>Æquilibrium</i>: This I take to be the cause, why near the Coast of
<i>Guinea</i> the Wind always sets in upon the Land, blowing Westerly
instead of Easterly, there being sufficient Reason to believe, that the
Inland Parts of <i>Africa</i> are prodigiously hot, since the Northern
Borders thereof were so intemperate, as to give the Ancients cause to
conclude, that all beyond the <i>Tropick</i>, was made uninhabitable by
excess of Heat: From the same Cause it happens, that there are so
constant Calms in that part of the Ocean, called the <i>Rains</i>,
(described in the 7th Remark on the <i>Atlantick</i> Sea) for this Tract
being placed in the middle, between the Westerly Winds blowing on the
Coast of <i>Guinea</i>, and the Easterly Trade-winds, blowing to the
Westwards thereof, the tendency of the Air here, is indifferent to
either, and so stands in <i>Æquilibrio</i> between both; and the weight
of the incumbent Atmosphere being diminished by the continual contrary
Winds blowing from hence, is the reason that the Air here holds not the
copious Vapour it receives, but lets it fall into frequent Rains.</p>

<p>But as the cool and dense Air, by reason of its greater Gravity,
presses upon the hot and rarified, 'tis demonstrative that this latter
must ascend in a continued Stream as fast it rarifies; and that being
ascended, it must disperse it self to preserve the <i>Æquilibrium</i>:
that is, by a contrary Current, the upper Air must move from those Parts
where the greatest Heat is: So by a kind of Circulation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
the North-East Trade-Wind below, will be attended with a South-Westerly
above, and the South-Easterly with a North-West Wind above; that this is
more than a bare Conjecture, the almost instantaneous Change of the Wind
to the opposite Point, which is frequently found in passing the limits
of the Trade-winds, seems to assure us; but that which above all
confirms this <i>Hypothesis</i> is the <i>Phænomenon</i> of the
<i>Monsoons</i>, by this means most easily solved, and without it hardly
explicable.</p>

<p>Supposing therefore such a Circulation, as above, 'tis to be
considered that to the Northward of the <i>Indian</i> Ocean there is
every where Land within the usual limit of the Latitude of 30,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Persia</i>, <i>India</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> which
for the same reason as the <i>Mediterranean</i> Parts of <i>Africa</i>,
are subject to unsufferable Heats when the Sun is to the North, passing
nearly Vertical; but yet are temperate enough when the Sun is removed
towards the other <i>Tropick</i>; because of a ridge of Mountains at
some distance within the Land, said to be frequently in Winter cover'd
with Snow, over which the Air, as it passes, must needs be much chill'd.
Hence it comes to pass, that the Air coming according to the general
Rule, out of the N. E. in the <i>Indian</i> Seas, is sometimes hotter,
sometimes colder, than that which by this Circulation is return'd out of
the S. W. and by consequence, sometimes the under Current or Wind, is
from the N. E. sometimes from the S. W.</p>

<p>That this has no other Cause, is clear from the times wherein these
Winds set in, <i>viz.</i> in <i>April</i>, when the Sun begins to warm
those Countries to the North, the S. W. <i>Monsoon</i> begins, and blows
during the Heats till <i>October</i>; when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Sun being retir'd, and all things growing cooler Northward, and the Heat
increasing to the South, the North-East Winds enter and blow all the
Winter till <i>April</i> again. And it is undoubtedly from the same
Principle that to the Southwards of the Æquator, in part of the
<i>Indian</i> Ocean, the North-West Winds succeed to the South-East,
when the Sun draws near the <i>Tropick</i> of <i>Capricorn</i>; but I
must confess, that in this latter occurs a difficulty, not well to be
accounted for, which is, why this Change of the <i>Monsoons</i> should
be any more in this Ocean, than in the same Latitudes in the
<i>Æthopick</i>, where there is nothing more certain than a S. E. Wind
all the Year.</p>

<p>'Tis likewise very hard to conceive why the limits of the Trade-wind
should be fixt, about the thirtieth Degree of Latitude all round the
Globe; and that they should so seldom transgress or fall short of those
bounds; as also that in the <i>Indian</i> Sea, only the Northern Part
should be subject to the changeable <i>Monsoons</i>, and in the Southern
there be a constant S. E.</p>

<p>These are Particulars that merit to be consider'd more at large, and
furnish a sufficient Subject for a just Volume, which will be a very
commendable Task for such, who being us'd to Philosophick Contemplation,
shall have leisure to apply their serious Thoughts about it.</p>

<h3>A Discourse of the Rule of the Decrease of the height of the

elevated above the Surface of the Earth; with an Attempt to discover the
true Reason of the Rising and Falling of the <strong>Mercury</strong>,
upon Change of Weather. By <strong>Edm. Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE Elastick Property of the Air has been long since
made out, by Experiments before the <i>Royal Society</i>, and elsewhere;
and the Resistance of its Spring is found to be nearly equal to the
Weight or Force that compresses it; as also, that the Spaces the same
Air occupies, under differing Pressures, are reciprocally as those
Pressures: It has been shewn likewise by undoubted Experiment, that the
specifick Gravity of the Air, near the Earth's Surface to that of Water,
was once as 1 to 840; again as 1 to 852; and a third time, in a very
large Vessel holding 10 Gallons, as 1 to 860; all which, considering the
Difficulty of the Experiment, agree well enough, the Mercury standing at
all those times about 29 Inches ¾: But by Reason 'twas Summer-weather,
and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
the Air rarified, when all these were tried, we may without sensible
Error say in round numbers, that the Barometer standing at 30 Inches,
and in a mean State of Heat and Cold, the specifick Gravity of the Air
to Water, is as 1 to 800. By the like Trials the weight of Mercury to
Water, is as 13½ to 1, or very near it; so that the weight of Mercury to
Air, is as 10800 to 1; and a Cylinder of Air of 10800 Inches or 900
Feet, is equal to an Inch of Mercury; and were the Air of an equal
density like Water, the whole Atmosphere would be no more than 5,1 Miles
high, and in the Ascent of every 900 Feet the Barometer would sink an
Inch. But the Expansion of the Air increasing in the same proportion as
the incumbent weight of the Atmosphere decreases; that is, as the
Mercury in the Barometer sinks; the upper Parts of the Air are much more
rarified than the lower, and each Space answering to an Inch of
Quicksilver, grows greater and greater; so that the Atmosphere must be
extended to a much greater height. Now, upon these Principles, to
determine the height of the Mercury at any assigned height in the Air;
and <i>è contra</i>, having the height of the <i>Mercury</i> given, to
find the height of the Place where the Barometer stands, are Problems
not more difficult than curious; and which I thus resolve.</p>

<p>The Expansions of the Air being reciprocally as the heights of the
Mercury, it is evident, that by the help of the Curve of the
<i>Hyperbola</i> and its <i>Asymptotes</i>, the said Expansions may be
expounded to any given height of the <i>Mercury</i>: For by the 65th
<i>Prop. lib. 2. Conic. Mydorgii</i>, <i>the Rectangles</i>,
<i>ABCE</i>, <i>AKGE</i>, <i>ALDE</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> (in <i>Plate 1. Fig.
4.</i>) are always equal, and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
the sides, <i>CB</i>, <i>GK</i>, <i>LD</i>, &amp;c. are reciprocally as the
sides <i>AB</i>, <i>AK</i>, <i>AL</i>, &amp;c. If then the Lines <i>AB</i>,
<i>AK</i>, <i>AL</i>, be supposed equal to the heights of the
<i>Mercury</i>, or the pressures of the Atmosphere, the Lines <i>CB</i>,
<i>GK</i>, <i>LD</i>, answering thereto, will be as the Expansions of
the Air under those Pressures, or the Bulks that the same quantity of
Air will occupy; which Expansions being taken infinitely many, and
infinitely little, (according to the Method of Indivisibles) their Summ
will give the Spaces of Air between the several heights of the
<i>Barometer</i>; that is to say, the Summ of all the Lines between
<i>CB</i> and <i>KG</i>, or the <i>Area</i> <i>CBKG</i>, will be
proportioned to the Distance or Space intercepted between the Levels of
two Places in the Air, where the <i>Mercury</i> would stand at the
heights represented by the Lines <i>AB</i>, <i>AK</i>; so then the
Spaces of Air answering to equal Parts of <i>Mercury</i> in the
<i>Barometer</i>, are as the <i>Area's</i> <i>CBKG</i>, <i>GKLD</i>,
<i>DLFM</i>, &amp;c. These <i>Area's</i> again are, by the Demonstration of
<i>Gregory</i> of St. <i>Vincent</i>, proportionate to the
<i>Logarithms</i> of the Numbers expressing the <i>Rationes</i> of
<i>AK</i> to <i>AB</i>, of <i>AL</i> to <i>AK</i>, of <i>AM</i> to
<i>AL</i>, &amp;c. So then by the common Table of <i>Logarithms</i>, the
height of any Place in the <i>Atmosphere</i>, having any assign'd height
of the <i>Mercury</i>, may most easily be found: For the Line <i>CB</i>
in the <i>Hyperbola</i>, whereof the <i>Area's</i> design the <i>Tabular
Logarithms</i>, being 0,0144765; 'twill be, as 0,0144765, to the
difference of the <i>Logarithms</i> of 30, or any other lesser Number,
for 900 Feet, or the Space answering to an Inch of <i>Mercury</i>, if
the Air were equally prest with 30 Inches of <i>Mercury</i>, and every
where alike, to the height of the <i>Barometer</i> in the Air, where it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
will stand at that lesser number of Inches: And by the Converse of this
Proportion may the height of the <i>Mercury</i> be found, having the
Altitude of the Place given. From these Rules I deriv'd the following
Tables.</p>

<p class="dropcap">UPON<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85"
id="Page_85">{85}</a></span> these Suppositions it appears, that at the
height of 41 Miles the Air is so rarified, as to take up 3000 times the
Space it occupies here, and at 53 Miles high it would be expanded above
30000 times; but it's probable that the utmost Power of its Spring
cannot exert it self, to so great an Extension, and that no part of the
<i>Atmosphere</i> reaches above 45 Miles from the Surface of the
Earth.</p>

<p>This seems confirm'd from the Observations of the <i>Crepusculum</i>,
which is observ'd commonly to begin and end when the Sun is about 18
Degrees below the Horizon; for supposing the Air to reflect light from
its most rarified Parts, and that as long as the Sun illuminates any of
its <i>Atoms</i>, they are visible to an Eye not intercepted by the
Curvity of the Earth, it will follow from <i>Fig. 5. Plate 1.</i> that
the proportion of the height of the whole Air, to the Semi-diameter of
the Earth, is much about, as 1 to 90, or as the excess of the
<i>Secant</i> of about 8½ Degrees to the <i>Radius</i>. For if <i>E</i>
be the Eye of the Observer, <i>S</i> a Place where the Sun sets at the
end of Twilight in <i>E</i>, and the Arch <i>ECS</i>, or <i>TCA</i>, be
found 18 Degrees, the excess of the <i>Secant</i> of half thereof
<i>ECH</i>, would be the height of the Air, <i>viz.</i> <i>GH</i>: But
the Beam of the Sun <i>ASH</i>, and the Visual Ray <i>EH</i>, do each of
them suffer a Refraction of about 32 or 33 Minutes, whereby being bent
inwards from <i>H</i> towards <i>G</i>, the height of the Air need not
be so great as if they went streight; and having from the Angle
<i>ECS</i> taken the double Refraction of the <i>Horizontal Ray</i>, the
half of the Remainder will be 8½ Degrees <i>circiter</i>, whose
<i>Secant</i> being 10,111, it follows, that as 10000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
to 111, so the Semi-diameter of the Earth supposed 4000 Miles, to 44,4
Miles; which will be the height of the whole Air, if the Places
<i>E</i>, <i>S</i>, whose visible Portions of the <i>Atmosphere</i>
<i>ERZH</i>, and <i>SHKB</i>, just touch one the other, be 18 Degrees
asunder.</p>

<p>At this height the Air is expanded into above 3000 times the space it
occupies here, and we have seen the Experience of condensing it into the
60th part of the same Space, so that it should seem, that the Air is a
Substance capable of being compressed into the 180000th part of the
Space it would naturally take up, when free from pressure. Now what
Texture or Composition of Parts shall be capable of this great Expansion
and Contraction, seems a very hard Question; and which, I suppose, is
scarce sufficiently accounted for, by comparing it to Wool, Cotten, and
the like springy Bodies.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have only consider'd the <i>Air</i> and <i>Atmosphere</i>,
as one unalter'd Body, as having constantly at the Earth's Surface the
800th part of the weight of Water, and being capable of Rarifaction and
Condensation <i>in infinitum</i>; neither of which <i>Hypotheses</i> are
rigidly true: For here in <i>England</i> it is notoriously known, that
the weight of the whole <i>Atmosphere</i> is various, being
counterpoised sometimes by 28½ Inches of <i>Mercury</i>, and at other
times by no less than 30½; so that the under parts being pressed by
about a 15th part, less weight, the <i>specifick</i> Gravity of the Air
upon that score will sometimes be a 15th part lighter than another;
besides Heat and Cold, does very considerably dilate and contract the
Air, and consequently alter its Gravity; to which add the mixture of
<i>Effluvia</i>, or steams arising from almost all Bodies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
which assimulating into the Form of Air, are kept suspended therein, as
Salts dissolv'd in Liquors, or Metals in corroding <i>Menstrua</i>;
which Bodies being all of them very much heavier than Air, their
Particles by their Admixture must needs encrease the weight of that Air
they lie incorporated withal, after the same manner as melted Salts do
augment the specifick Gravity of Water. The other Consideration is, that
the Rarifaction and Condensation of the Air is not precisely according
to the proportion here laid down; for the Experiment very nearly agrees
thereto, as may be seen in the 58th Chapter of Mr. <i>Hook's</i>
<i>Micrography</i>; yet are the Condensations not possible beyond
certain degrees: For being compressed into an 800th part of the Space it
takes up here, its consistence would be equally dense with that of
Water; which yields not to any force whatsoever, as hath been found by
several Experiments tried here, and at <i>Florence</i>, by the
<i>Academia del Cimento</i>. Nor can the Rarifaction proceed <i>in
infinitum</i>; for supposing the Spring whereby it dilates it self,
occasion'd by what Texture of Parts you please, yet must there be a
determinate Magnitude of the natural State of each Particle, as we see
it is in Wool, and the like, whose Bodies being compressable into a very
small Space, have yet a determinate bulk which they cannot exceed, when
free'd from all manner of Pressure.</p>

<p>These Objections being true, do disturb the Geometrical Accuracy of
these Conclusions, drawn from the specifick Gravity of the Air observ'd
at any time; but the Method here shewn will compute by a like
Calculation, the heights of the Quick-silver, and the Rarifactions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
of the Air from any assign'd height of the <i>Barometer</i> at the
Earth's Surface, and any specifick Gravity given. As to the Condensation
and Rarifaction by Heat and Cold, and the various mixture of Aqueous and
other Vapours, these two Objections seem generally to compensate each
other; for when the Air is rarified by Heat, they are raised most
copiously; so that though the Air properly so call'd, be expanded, and
consequently lighter, yet the <i>Interstices</i> thereof being crouded
full of Vapours of much heavier Matters, bulk for bulk, the weight of
the <i>Compositum</i> may continue much the same, at least a most
curious Experiment made by the Ingenious Mr. <i>John Caswell</i>, of
<i>Oxford</i>, upon the top of <i>Snowdon</i> Hill, in
<i>Carnarvanshire</i>, seems to prove, that the first Inches of
<i>Mercury</i> have their Portions of Air near enough to what I now
determine: For the height of the Hill being 1240 Yards, or very near it,
he found the <i>Mercury</i> to have subsided to 25,6 Inches, or 4 inches
below the mean Altitude thereof at the Level of the Sea, (which is a
greater difference than has been found in any of our former
Experiments,) and the Space answering to 4 Inches, by my Calculation,
should be 1288 Yards; and it agrees as well with the Observations in the
Appendix to Mr. <i>Pascall</i>'s Book, <i>del Equilibre des
Liqueurs</i>, made on the high Hill in <i>Auvergne</i>, call'd <i>le puy
de Domme</i>. So that the Rarifaction and Vapours seem not to have
alter'd considerably, the Gravity of the under Parts of the <i>Air</i>;
and much above the height where these Experiments were made, do few
Vapours ascend, and the Cold is such that the Snow lies continually, so
that for the more elevated Parts of the Sphere of <i>Air</i>, there is
much less Reason to doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
But now we have had occasion to mention the difference there is between
the height of the <i>Mercury</i> at one time, from the height thereof at
another, it may not be unacceptable to offer at some Reasons for the
said difference; which, at least to my self, seem to have some
appearance of Truth. <i>First</i>, Then it's undoubtedly demonstrable,
that the height of the Cylinder of <i>Mercury</i> is equal to the weight
of the whole incumbent Air, and consequently that that whole is
sometimes a fifteenth more than at other times; which cannot otherwise
be, but by the access of new Matter when 'tis heavy, and its diminution
when 'tis light; that <i>Hypothesis</i> therefore that shews how the Air
shall be encreased or diminished, in any particular place, will give a
Reason for the greater and lesser height of the <i>Mercury</i> in the
<i>Baroscope</i>: But to direct us in the choice of the several Causes,
which may be assign'd for the Increase and Decrease of the Air, 'twill
not be unnecessary to enumerate some of the principal Observations made
upon the <i>Barometer</i>, most whereof are sufficiently known already
to all those that are curious in these Matters.</p>

<p>The <i>First</i> is, That in calm Weather, when the Air is inclin'd
to Rain, the <i>Mercury</i> is commonly low.</p>

<p>2. That in serene good settled Weather, the <i>Mercury</i> is
generally high.</p>

<p>3. That upon very great Winds, though they be not accompanied with
Rain, the <i>Mercury</i> sinks lowest of all, with relation to the Point
of the Compass the Wind blows upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
4. That <i>cæteris paribus</i> the greatest heights of the
<i>Mercury</i> are found upon Easterly and North-Easterly Winds.</p>

<p>5. That in calm frosty Weather the <i>Mercury</i> generally stands
high.</p>

<p>6. That after very great Storms of Wind, when the <i>Quicksilver</i>
has been low, it generally rises again very fast.</p>

<p>7. That the more Northerly places have greater Alterations of the
<i>Baroscope</i>, than the more Southerly.</p>

<p>8. That within the <i>Tropicks</i> and near them, those Accounts I
have had from others, and my own Observation at St. <i>Helena</i>, make
very little or no Variation of the height of the <i>Mercury</i> in all
Weathers.</p>

<p class="gap-above">Now that Theory that can well account for all these
appearances, will, in all probability, approach nearer the true cause of
the <i>Barometers</i> Variations, than any thing hitherto afforded; and
such an one I am bound to believe, is that which I here lay down with
submission to better Judgments.</p>

<p>I conceive that the principal Cause of the rise and fall of the
<i>Mercury</i>, is from the variable Winds, which are found in the
<i>Temperate Zones</i>, and whose great unconstancy here in
<i>England</i> is most notorious. I shall not at present inquire into
the Cause of its uncertainty, but the Matter of Fact being most
undoubted, the Legitimate Consequences thereof must be allow'd me, let
it proceed from what it will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
A second Cause is the uncertain Exhalation and Præcipitation of the
Vapours lodging in the Air, whereby it comes to be at one time much more
crowded than at another, and consequently heavier; but this latter in a
great measure depends upon the former. Now from these Principles I shall
endeavour to explicate the several <i>Phænomena</i> of the
<i>Barometer</i>, taking them in the same order I laid them down.</p>

<p>1. <i>Why in calm Weather the Air being inclin'd to Rain, the
<strong>Mercury</strong> is commonly low?</i> I Answer, That the
<i>Mercury</i>'s being low, inclines it to Rain; for the Air being
light, the Vapours are no longer supported thereby, being become
specifically heavier than the Medium wherein they floated; so that they
descend towards the Earth, and in their fall meeting with other aqueous
Particles, they incorporate together, and form little drops of Rain; but
the <i>Mercury</i>'s being at one time lower than another, is the effect
of two contrary Winds blowing from the place whence the <i>Barometer</i>
stands; whereby the Air of that place is carried both ways from it, and
consequently the incumbent Cylinder of Air is diminished, and
accordingly the <i>Mercury</i> sinks; as for Instance, if in the
<i>German Ocean</i> it should blow a Gale of Westerly Wind, and at the
same time an Easterly Wind in the <i>Irish Sea</i>; or if in
<i>France</i> it should blow a Southerly Wind, and in <i>Scotland</i> a
Northern; it must be granted me, that That part of the <i>Atmosphere</i>
impendent over <i>England</i>, would thereby be exhausted and
attenuated, and the <i>Mercury</i> would subside, and the Vapours which
before floated in those parts of the <i>Air</i> of equal Gravity with
themselves, would sink to the Earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
2. <i>Why in serene good settled weather the <strong>Mercury</strong> is
generally high?</i> To this I Answer, That the greater height of the
<i>Barometer</i>, is occasion'd by two contrary Winds blowing towards
the place of Observation, whereby the Air of other places is brought
thither and accumulated; so that the incumbent Cylinder of Air being
encreas'd both in height and weight, the <i>Mercury</i> press'd thereby
must needs rise and stand high, as long as the Winds continue so to
blow; and then the Air being specifically heavier, the Vapours are
better kept suspended, so that they have no inclination to Præcipitate
and fall down in Drops, which is the reason of the serene good Weather,
which attends the greater heights of the <i>Mercury</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Why upon very great Winds or Storms, tho' accompanied with no
Rain, the <strong>Mercury</strong> sinks lowest of all, with relation to the
Point of the Compass upon which the Wind blows?</i> This is caus'd by
the very rapid Motion of the Air in these Storms; for the Tract or
Region of the Earths Surface, wherein these Winds rage, not extending
all round the Globe, that stagnant Air which is left behind, as
likewise that on the sides, cannot come in so fast as to supply the
Evacuation made by so swift a Current; so that the Air must necessarily
be attenuated, when and where the said Winds continue to blow, and that
more or less, according to their Violence; add to which, that the
<i>Horizontal</i> Motion of the Air being so quick as it is, may in all
probability take off some part of the perpendicular pressure thereof;
and the great Agitation of its Particles, is the Reason why the Vapours
are dissipated, and do not condense into Drops,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
so as to form Rain, otherwise the natural Consequence of the Airs
Rarifaction.</p>

<p>4. <i>Why <strong>cæteris paribus</strong> the
<strong>Mercury</strong> stands highest upon an Easterly or
North-Easterly Wind?</i> This happens because that in the great
<i>Atlantick Ocean</i>, on this side the thirty fifth Degree of North
Latitude, the Westerly and South-Westerly Trade-Winds blow almost
always; so that whenever here the Wind comes up at East and North-East,
'tis sure to be checked by a contrary Gale, as soon as it reaches the
Ocean; wherefore, according to what is made out in our second Remark,
the Air must needs be heaped over this Island; and consequently the
<i>Mercury</i> must stand high, as often as these Winds blow. This holds
true in this Country, but is not a general Rule for others, where the
Winds are under different Circumstances; and I have sometimes seen the
<i>Mercury</i> here as low as twenty nine Inches, upon an Easterly Wind,
but then it blows exceeding hard, and so comes to be accounted for by
what was observ'd upon the third Remark.</p>

<p>5. <i>Why in calm Weather the <strong>Mercury</strong> generally
stands high?</i> The cause hereof is, as I conceive, that it seldom
freezes but when the Winds come out of the Northern and North-Eastern
Quarters, or at least unless those Winds blow at no great distance off;
for the Northern Parts of <i>Germany</i>, <i>Denmark</i>, <i>Sweden</i>,
<i>Norway</i>, and all that Tract from whence North-Eastern Winds come,
are subject to almost continual Frost all the Winter; and thereby the
lower Air is very much condens'd, and in that State is brought
hitherwards by these Winds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
and being accumulated by the opposition of the Westerly Wind blowing in
the Ocean, the <i>Mercury</i> must needs be prest to a more than
ordinary height, and as a concurring Cause, the shrinking of the lower
parts of the Air into lesser room by cold, must needs cause a descent
of the upper parts of the Atmosphere, to reduce the Cavity made by this
contraction to an <i>Æquilibrium</i>.</p>

<p>6. <i>Why after very great Storms of Wind, when the <strong>Mercury</strong> has
been very low, it generally rises again very fast?</i> This I have
frequently observed, and once found it risen an Inch and a half in less
than six Hours, after a long continu'd Storm of South-West Wind. This
seems to be occasion'd by the sudden Accession of new Air to supply the
great Evacuation which such continu'd Storms make thereof, in those
places whence they happen (as in the third Remark) and by the Recoile
of the Air, after the force ceases that impelled it; and the Reason why
the <i>Mercury</i> rises so fast, is because the Air being very much
rarify'd beyond its mean density, the Neighbouring Air runs in the more
swiftly to bring it to an <i>Æquilibration</i>, as we see Water runs
the faster for having a great declivity.</p>

<p>7. <i>Why in more Northerly places the Variations of the
<strong>Baroscope</strong> are greater than in the Southerly?</i> The truth of
the Matter of Fact is prov'd from Observations made at <i>Clermont</i>
and <i>Paris</i>, compar'd with others, made at <i>Stockholm</i>, as
may be seen in the Appendix to Mr. <i>Pascal</i>'s Book before-cited.
The Reason I conjecture to be, that the more Northerly Parts have
usually greater Storms of Wind than the more Southerly, whereby the
<i>Mercury</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
should sink lower in that Extream; and then the Northerly Winds bringing
the condens'd and ponderous Air from the Neighbourhood of the Pole, and
that again being check'd by a Southerly Wind, at no great distance, and
so heaped, must of necessity make the <i>Mercury</i> in such case stand
higher in the other Extream.</p>

<p>8. And Lastly, <i>Why near the <strong>Æquinoctial</strong>, as at
<strong>Barbadoes</strong> and St. <strong>Helena</strong>, there is very little or no
Variation of the height of the Barometer?</i> This Remark, above all
others, confirms the Hypothesis of the variable Winds, being the cause
of these Variations of the height of the <i>Mercury</i>; for in the
Places above-named, there is always an easie Gale of Wind blowing
nearly upon the same Point, <i>viz.</i> E. N. E. at <i>Barbadoes</i>,
and E. S. E. at St. <i>Helena</i>; so that there being no contrary
Currents of the Air, to exhaust or accumulate it, the Atmosphere
continues much in the same State. However, upon Hurricanes, the most
violent of Storms, the <i>Mercury</i> has been observ'd very low, but
this is but for once in two or three Years, and it soon recovers its
settled state of about 29½ Inches. I doubt not but the same thing is
in the East Coast of <i>Africa</i>, and in <i>India</i>, where the
Monsoons or Trade-Winds are for half the Year one way, and half the
Year another; only it's probable, that there may something worth noting
happen, about the times of the change or shifting of the Winds, which
might be obtain'd, if any Body had the Curiosity to keep the
<i>Barometer</i> at our Factories in <i>India</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I doubt not but this Doctrine will find some
Opposers, and that one principal Objection will be, that I suppose the
Air sometimes to move from those Parts where it is already evacuated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
below the <i>Æquilibrium</i>, and sometimes again towards those parts,
where it is condens'd and crouded above the mean State, which may be
thought contradictory to the Laws of Staticks and the Rules of the
<i>Æquilibrium</i> of Fluids. But those that shall consider how, when
once an impetus is given to a Fluid Body, it is capable of mounting
above its Level, and checking others that have a contrary tendency to
descent by their own Gravity, will no longer regard this as a material
Obstacle, but will rather conclude, that the great <i>Analogy</i> there
is between the rising and falling of the Water upon the Flux and Reflux
of the Sea, and this of the accumulating and extenuating the Air, is a
great Argument for the Truth of this Hypothesis: For as the Sea over
against the Coast of <i>Essex</i>, rises and swells by the meeting of
the two contrary Tides of Flood, (whereof the one comes from the S. W.
along the Channel of <i>England</i>, and the other from the North); and
on the contrary sinks below its Level upon the retreat of the Water both
ways in the Tide of Ebb; so it is very probable that the Air may Ebb and
Flow, after the same manner; but by reason of the diversity of Causes,
whereby the Air may be set in moving, the times of these Fluxes and
Refluxes thereof, are purely Casual, and not reducible to any Rule, as
are the Motions of the Sea, depending wholly upon the regular Course of
the Moon.</p>

<h3>A Letter of Mr. <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>, Professor of the

<p><i><span class="gesperrt">SI</span>R,</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">TO perform my late promise to you, I shall without
further Ceremony acquaint you, That in the beginning of the Year 1666
(at which time I apply'd my self to the grinding of Optick-glasses of
other Figures than <i>Spherical</i>,) I procur'd me a Triangular
Glass-Prism, to try therewith the celebrated <i>Phænomena</i> of
<i>Colours</i>. And in order thereto, having darken'd my Chamber, and
made a small hole in my Window-shuts, to let in a convenient quantity of
the Sun's Light, I plac'd my Prism at his entrance, that it might be
thereby refracted to the opposite Wall. It was at first a very pleasing
Divertisement, to view the vivid and intense Colours produced thereby;
but after a while applying my self to consider them more circumspectly,
I became surpriz'd to see them in an <i>oblong</i> Form; which,
according to the received Laws of Rarefraction, I expected should have
been <i>Circular</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
They were terminated at the sides with streight Lines, but at the ends,
the decay of Light was so gradual, that it was difficult to determine
justly, what was their Figure; yet they seem'd <i>Semicircular</i>.</p>

<p>Comparing the length of this colour'd <i>Spectrum</i> with its
breadth, I found it about five times greater; a disproportion so
extravagant, that it excited me to a more than ordinary Curiosity of
examining, from whence it might proceed. I could scarce think, that the
various thickness of the Glass, or the termination with shadow or
darkness, could have any Influence on Light to produce such an effect;
yet I thought it not amiss, first to examine those Circumstances, and so
try'd what would happen by transmitting Light through parts of the Glass
of divers thicknesses, or through holes in the Window of divers
bignesses, or by setting the Prism without, so that the Light might pass
through it, and be refracted before it was terminated by the hole: But I
found none of those Circumstances material. The fashion of the Colours
was, in all these Cases, the same.</p>

<p>Then I suspected, whether by any unevenness in the Glass, or other
contingent Irregularity, these Colours might be thus dilated. And to try
this, I took another Prism like the former, and so plac'd it, that the
Light passing through them both, might be refracted contrary ways, and
so by the latter return'd into that Course, from which the former had
diverted it. For, by this means, I thought the <i>regular</i> effects of
the first Prism would be destroy'd by the second Prism, but the
<i>irregular</i> ones more augmented by the multiplicity of Refractions.
The Event was, that the Light, which by the first Prism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
was diffused into an <i>oblong</i> Form, was, by the second, reduc'd
into an <i>orbicular</i> one, with as much regularity, as when it did
not at all pass through them. So that whatever was the cause of that
length, 'twas not any contingent Irregularity.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to examine more critically, what might be effected
by the difference of the incidence of Rays coming from divers parts of
the Sun; and to that end, measur'd the several Lines and Angles
belonging to the Image. Its distance from the Hole or Prism was twenty
two Foot; its utmost length 13¼ Inches; its breadth 2⅝; the Diameter of
the Hole ¼ of an Inch; the Angle, with the Rays, tending towards the
middle of the Image, made with those Lines, in which they would have
proceeded without Refraction, was 44° 56'. And the Vertical Angle of the
Prism, 63° 12'. Also the Refractions on both sides the Prism, that is,
of the Incident, and Emergent Rays, were as near, as I could make them,
equal, and consequently about 54° 4'. And the Rays fell perpendicularly
upon the Wall. Now subducting the Diameter of the Hole from the length
and breadth of the Image, there remains 13 Inches the length, and 2⅜ the
breadth, comprehended by those Rays, which passed thro' the Center of
the said Hole, and consequently the Angle of the Hole, which that
breadth subtended, was about 31', answerable to the Sun's Diameter; but
the Angle, which its length subtended, was more than five such
Diameters, namely 2° 49'.</p>

<p>Having made these Observations, I first computed from them the
refractive Power of that Glass, and found it measur'd by the
<i>ratio</i> of the Sines, twenty to thirty one. And then, by that
<i>ratio</i>, I computed the Refractions of two Rays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
flowing from opposite parts of the Sun's <i>discus</i>, so as to differ
31' in their obliquity of Incidence, and found that the emergent Rays
should have comprehended an Angle of about 31', as they did, before they
were incident.</p>

<p>But because this Computation was founded on the Hypothesis of the
proportionality of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction, which, tho' by
my own Experience I could not imagine to be so erroneous as to make that
Angle but 31', which in reality was 2° 49'; yet my Curiosity caus'd me
again to take my Prism. And having plac'd it at my Window, as before, I
observ'd, that by turning it a little about its <i>Axis</i> to and fro,
so as to vary its obliquity to the light, more than an Angle of four or
five Degrees, the Colours were not thereby sensibly translated from
their place on the Wall, and consequently by that Variation of
Incidence, the quantity of Refraction was not sensibly varied. By this
Experiment therefore, as well as by the former Computation, it was
evident, that the difference of the Incidence of Rays, flowing from
divers parts of the Sun could not make them, after decussation, diverge
at a sensibly greater Angle, than that at which they before converged;
which being, at most, but about thirty one or thirty two Minutes, there
still remain'd some other cause to be found out, from whence it could be
two Deg. 49 Min.</p>

<p>Then I began to suspect, whether the Rays, after their Trajection
through the Prism, did not move in curve Lines, and according to their
more or less Curvity, tend to divers parts of the Wall. And it increas'd
my suspicion, when I remember'd that I had often seen a Tennis-Ball,
struck with an oblique Racket, describe such a curve Line. For a
Circular as well as a Progressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
Motion being communicated to it by that stroak, its parts on that side,
where the Motions conspire, must press and beat the contiguous Air more
violently than on the other, and there excite a Reluctancy and Reaction
of the Air proportionably greater. And for the same Reason, if the Rays
of Light should possibly be globular Bodies, and by their oblique
Passage out of one Medium into another, acquire a circulating Motion,
they ought to feel the greater resistance from the ambient Æther, on
that side, where this Motion conspires, and thence be continually bowed
to the other. But notwithstanding this plausible ground of suspicion,
when I came to examine it, I could observe no such Curvity in them. And
besides (which was enough for my purpose) I observ'd, that the
difference 'twixt the length of the Image, and Diameter of the Hole,
through which the Light was transmitted, was proportionable to their
distance.</p>

<p>The gradual removal of these suspicions, at length led me to the
<i>Experimentum Crucis</i>, which was this; I took two Boards, and
plac'd one of them close behind the Prism at the Window, so that the
light might pass through a small hole, made in it for the purpose, and
fall on the other Board, which I plac'd at about twelve Feet distance,
having first made a small hole in it also, for some of that incident
Light to pass through. Then I plac'd another Prism behind this second
Board, so that the Light, trajected through both the Boards, might pass
thro' that also, and be again refracted before it arrived at the Wall.
This done, I took the first Prism in my Hand, and turn'd it to and fro
slowly about its <i>Axis</i>, so much as to make the several parts of
the Image, cast on the second Board,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
successively pass through the hole in it, that I might observe to what
places on the Wall the second Prism would refract them. And I saw by the
Variation of those places, that the Light, tending to that end of the
Image, towards which the Refraction of the first Prism was made, did, in
the second Prism, suffer a Refraction considerably greater than the
Light tending to the other end. And so the true cause of the length of
that Image was detected to be no other, than that <i>Light</i> consists
of <i>Rays differently refrangible</i>, which, without any respect to a
difference in their incidence, were, according to their degrees of
Refrangibility, transmitted towards divers parts of the Wall.</p>

<p>When I understood this, I left off my aforesaid Glass Works; for I
saw, that the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much
for want of Glasses truly figur'd, according to the prescriptions of
Optick Authors (which all Men have hitherto imagin'd), as because that
Light it self is a <i>Heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible
Rays</i>. So that, were a Glass so exactly figur'd, so as to collect any
one sort of Rays into one Point, it could not collect those also into
the same Point, which having the same Incidence upon the same Medium,
are apt to suffer a different Refraction. Nay, I wonder'd, that seeing
the difference of Refrangibility was so great, as I found it, Telescopes
should arrive to that perfection they are now at. For, measuring the
Refractions in one of my Prisms, I found, that, supposing the common
Sine of Incidence upon one of its plains, was forty four Parts, the Sine
of Refraction of the utmost Rays on the red end of the Colours, made out
of the Glass into the Air, would be sixty eight parts, and the Sine of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
Refraction of the utmost Rays on the other end, sixty nine parts; so
that the difference is about a twenty fourth or twenty fifth part of the
whole Refraction. And consequently the Object glass of any Telescope
cannot collect all the Rays, which come from one point of an Object, so
as to make them convene at its <i>Focus</i> in less room than in a
Circular space, whose Diameter is the fiftieth part of the Diameter of
its Aperture; which is an irregularity, some hundred of times greater,
than a circularly figur'd <i>Lens</i>, of so small a section as the
Object-glasses of long Telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of
its Figure, were Light <i>uniform</i>.</p>

<p>This made me take <i>Reflections</i> into Consideration, and finding
them regular, so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was
equal to their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their
mediation, Optick Instruments might be brought to any degree of
Perfection imaginable, provided a <i>Reflecting</i> Substance could be
found, which would polish as finely as Glass, and <i>reflect</i> as much
Light as Glass <i>transmits</i>; and the art of communicating to it a
<i>Parabolick</i> Figure be also attain'd. But there seem'd very great
Difficulties, and I have almost thought them insuperable, when I further
consider'd, that every Irregularity in a reflecting Superficies makes
the Rays stray five or six times more out of their due course, than the
like Irregularities in a refracting one; So that a much greater
Curiosity would be here requisite, than in Figuring Glasses for
Refraction.</p>

<p>Amidst these Thoughts I was forc'd from <i>Cambridge</i> by the
Intervening Plague, and it was more than two Years before I proceeded
further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
proper for Metal, whereby, as I imagin'd, the Figure also would be
corrected to the last; I began to try what might be effected in this
kind, and by degrees so far perfected an Instrument (in the essential
parts of it like that I sent to <i>London</i>,) by which I could discern
<i>Jupiter</i>'s four Concomitants, and shew'd them divers times to two
others of my Acquaintance. I could also discern the Moon-like Phase of
<i>Venus</i>, but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in
disposing the Instrument.</p>

<p>From that time I was interrupted, till this last Autumn, when I made
the other. And as that was sensibly better than the first (especially
for Day-Objects,) so I doubt not but they will be still brought to a
much greater perfection by their Endeavours, who, as you inform me, are
taking care about it at <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>I have sometimes thought to make a <i>Microscope</i>, which in like
manner should have, instead of an Object-glass, a reflecting piece of
Metal. And this I hope they will also take into Consideration: For those
Instruments seem as capable of improvement as <i>Telescopes</i>, and
perhaps more, because but one reflective piece of Metal is requisite in
them, as you may perceive in <i>Plate 3. Fig. 1.</i> where <i>AB</i>
representeth the Object Metal, <i>CD</i> the Eye-glass, <i>F</i> their
common Focus, and <i>O</i> the other Focus of the Metal, in which the
Object is placed.</p>

<p>But to return from this digression, I told you, that Light is not
similar, or homogeneal, but consists of <i>difform</i> Rays, some of
which are more refrangible than others: So that of those, which are
alike incident on the same Medium, some shall be more refracted than
others, and that not by any virtue of the Glass, or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
external Cause, but from a predisposition, which every particular Ray
hath to suffer a particular degree of Refraction.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable
deformity in its Rays, wherein the <i>Origin of Colours</i> is unfolded:
Concerning which I shall lay down the <i>Doctrine</i> first, and then,
for its Examination, give you an Instance or two of the
<i>Experiments</i>, as a Specimen of the rest.</p>

<p>The Doctrine you will find comprehended and illustrated in the
following Propositions.</p>

<p>1. As the Rays of Light differ in degrees of Refrangibility, so they
also differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular
Colour. Colours are not <i>Qualifications of Light</i>, derived from
Refractions, or Reflections of natural Bodies, (as 'tis generally
believed) but <i>Original</i> and <i>connate Properties</i>, which in
divers Rays are divers. Some Rays are disposed to exhibit a red Colour
and no other; some a yellow and no other, some a green and no other, and
so of the rest. Nor are there only Rays proper and particular to the
more eminent Colours, but even to all their intermediate Gradations.</p>

<p>2. To the same degree of Refrangibility ever belongs the same Colour,
and to the same Colour ever belongs the same degree of Refrangibility.
The <i>least Refrangible</i> Rays are all disposed to exhibit a
<i>Red</i> Colour, and contrarily those Rays, which are disposed to
exhibit a <i>Red</i> Colour, are all the least Refrangible: So the
<i>most Refrangible</i> Rays are all disposed to exhibit a deep
<i>Violet Colour</i>, and contrarily those which are apt to exhibit such
a <i>Violet Colour</i>, are all the most Refrangible. And so to all the
intermediate Colours in a continued Series belong intermediate degrees
of Refrangibility. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
this Analogy 'twixt Colours, and Refrangibility, is very precise and
strict; the Rays always either exactly agreeing in both, or
proportionally disagreeing in both.</p>

<p>3. The Species of Colour, and Degree of Refrangibility proper to any
particular sort of Rays, is not mutable by Refraction, nor by Reflection
from Natural Bodies, nor by any other Cause, that I could yet observe.
When any one sort of Rays hath been well parted from those of other
kinds, it hath afterwards obstinately retain'd its Colour,
notwithstanding my utmost Endeavours to change it. I have refracted it
with Prisms, and reflected it with Bodies, which in Day-light were of
other Colours; I have intercepted it with the colour'd Film of Air
interceding two compressed Plates of Glass; transmitted it through
colour'd Mediums, and through Mediums irradiated with other sorts of
Rays, and diversly terminated it, and yet could never produce any new
Colour out of it. It would by contracting and dilating become more
brisk, or faint, and by the loss of many Rays in some Cases very obscure
and dark; but I could never see it chang'd <i>in specie</i>.</p>

<p>4. Yet seeming Transmutations of Colours may be made, where there is
any mixture of divers sorts of Rays. For in such mixtures, the component
Colours appear not, but by their mutual allaying each other, constitute
a midling Colour. And therefore, if by Refraction, or any other of the
aforesaid Causes, the difform Rays, latent in such a mixture, be
separated, there shall emerge Colours different from the colour of the
Composition. Which Colours are not new generated, but only made apparent
by being parted; for if they be again intirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
mix'd and blended together, they will again compose that Colour, which
they did before separation. And for the same reason, Transmutations made
by the convening of divers Colours are not real; for when the difform
Rays are again severed, they will exhibit the very same Colours, which
they did before they entered the Composition; as you see, <i>Blue</i>
and <i>Yellow</i> Powders, when finely mixed, appear to the naked Eye
<i>Green</i>, and yet the Colours of the component Corpuscles are not
thereby really transmuted, but only blended. For, when viewed with a
good Microscope, they still appear <i>Blue</i> and <i>Yellow</i>
interspersedly.</p>

<p>5. There are therefore two sorts of Colours. The one Original and
Simple, the other compounded of these. The Original or Primary Colours
are, <i>Red</i>, <i>Yellow</i>, <i>Green</i>, <i>Blue</i>, and a
<i>Violet-purple</i>, together with Orange, Indico, and an indefinite
variety of intermediate Gradations.</p>

<p>6. The same Colours in <i>Specie</i> with these primary Ones, may be
also produced by Composition: For, a mixture of <i>Yellow</i> and
<i>Blue</i> makes <i>Green</i>; of <i>Red</i> and <i>Yellow</i>, makes
<i>Orange</i>; of <i>Orange</i> and <i>Yellowish Green</i>, makes
<i>Yellow</i>. And in general, if any two Colours be mix'd, which in the
Series of those, generated by the Prism, are not too far distant one
from another, they by their mutual Alloy compound that Colour, which in
the said Series appeareth in the mid-way between them. But those, which
are situated at too great a distance, do not so. <i>Orange</i> and
<i>Indico</i> produce not the intermediate <i>Green</i>, nor
<i>Scarlet</i> and <i>Green</i> the intermediate <i>Yellow</i>.</p>

<p>7. But the most surprizing and wonderful Composition was that of
<i>Whiteness</i>. There is no one sort of Rays which alone can exhibit
this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
'Tis ever compounded, and to its Composition are requisite all the
aforesaid primary Colours, mix'd in a due proportion. I have often with
admiration beheld, that all the Colours of the Prism being made to
converge, and thereby to be again mixed as they were in the light before
it was incident upon the Prism, reproduced light, intirely and perfectly
white, and not at all sensibly differing from a <i>direct</i> light of
the Sun, unless when the Glasses, I used, were not sufficiently clear;
for then they would a little incline it to <i>their</i> Colour.</p>

<p>8. Hence therefore it comes to pass, that <i>Whiteness</i> is the
usual Colour of <i>Light</i>; for Light is a confused aggregate of Rays,
indued with all sorts of Colours, as they are promiscuously darted from
the various parts of luminous Bodies. And of such a confused aggregate,
as I said, is generated Whiteness, if there be a due proportion of the
Ingredients; but if any one predominate, the Light must incline to that
Colour; as it happens in the blue Flame of Brimstone, the yellow Flame
of a Candle, and the various Colours of the fixed Stars.</p>

<p>9. These things consider'd, the <i>manner</i>, how Colours are
produced by the Prism, is evident. For, of the Rays, constituting the
incident Light, since those which differ in Colour proportionally differ
in Refrangibility, <i>they</i> by their unequal Refractions must be
severed and dispersed into an oblong Form, in an orderly succession,
from the least refracted Scarlet to the most refracted Violet. And for
the same reason it is, that Objects, when look'd upon through a Prism,
appear coloured. For the difform Rays, by their unequal Refractions, are
made to diverge towards several parts of the <i>Retina</i>, and there
express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
the Images of things coloured, as in the former case they did the Sun's
Image upon a Wall. And by this inequality of Refractions, they become
not only coloured, but also very confused and indistinct.</p>

<p>10. Why the Colours of the <i>Rainbow</i> appear in falling drops of
Rain, is also from hence evident. For those drops, which refract the
Rays, disposed to appear Purple, in greatest quantity to the Spectator's
Eye, refract the Rays of other sorts so much less, as to make them pass
beside it; and such are the drops on the inside of the <i>Primary</i>
Bow, and on the outside of the <i>Secondary</i> or Exteriour one. So
those drops, which refract in greatest plenty the Rays, apt to appear
red, toward the Spectator's Eye, refract those of other sorts so much
more, as to make them pass beside it; and such are the drops on the
Exteriour part of the <i>Primary</i>, and Interiour part of the
<i>Secondary</i> Bow.</p>

<p>11. The odd Phænomena of an infusion of <i>Lignum Nephriticum</i>,
<i>Leaf-gold</i>, <i>Fragments of colour'd Glass</i>, and some other
transparently coloured Bodies, appearing in one Position of one Colour,
and of another in another, are on these grounds no longer Riddles. For
those are Substances apt to reflect one sort of Light, and transmit
another; as may be seen in a dark Room, by illuminating them with
similar or uncompounded Light. For then they appear of that Colour only,
with which they are illuminated; but yet in one Position more vivid and
luminous than in another, accordingly as they are disposed more or less
to reflect or transmit the incident Colour.</p>

<p>12. From hence also is manifest the reason of an unexpected
Experiment, which Mr. <i>Hook</i>, somewhere in his <i>Micrography</i>,
relates to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
made with two wedge-like transparent Vessels fill'd, the one with a red,
the other with a blue Liquor; namely, that though they were severally
transparent enough, yet both together became opake: For, if one
transmitted only red, and the other only blue, no Rays could pass
through both.</p>

<p>13. I might add more Instances of this Nature; but I shall conclude
with this general one, that the Colours of all natural Bodies have no
other Origin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one
sort of Light in greater plenty than another. And this I have
experimented in a dark Room, by illuminating those Bodies with
uncompounded Light of divers Colours. For by that means any body may be
made to appear of any Colour. They have there no appropriate Colour, but
ever appear of the Colour of the Light cast upon them; but yet with this
difference, that they are most brisk and vivid in the Light of their own
day-light-colour. <i>Minium</i> appeareth there of any Colour
indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in
red; and so <i>Bise</i> appeareth indifferently of any Colour with which
'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blue. And therefore
<i>Minium</i> reflecteth Rays of any Colour, but most copiously those
endu'd with red, and consequently when illustrated with day-light, that
is, with all sorts of Rays promiscuously blended, those qualified with
red, shall abound most in the reflected Light, and by their prevalence
cause it to appear of that Colour. And for the same reason <i>Bise</i>,
reflecting blue most copiously, shall appear blue by the excess of those
Rays in its reflected Light; and the like of other Bodies. And that this
is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
intire and adequate cause of their Colours, is manifest, because they
have no power to change or alter the Colours of any sort of Rays
incident apart, but put on all Colours indifferently, with which they
are enlightned.</p>

<p>These things being so, it can be no longer disputed, whether there be
Colours in the dark, nor whether they be the Qualities of the Objects we
see, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours are the
<i>Qualities</i> of Light, having its Rays for their intire and
immediate Subject, how can we think those Rays <i>Qualities</i> also,
unless one Quality may be the Subject of and sustain another; which in
effect is to call it <i>Substance</i>? We should not know Bodies for
Substances, were it not for their sensible Qualities; and the principal
of those being now found due to something else, we have as good reason
to believe that to be a Substance also.</p>

<p>Besides, whoever thought any Quality to be a <i>heterogeneous</i>
Aggregate, such as Light is discovered to be? But to determine more
absolutely, what Light is, after what manner refracted, and by what
Modes or Actions it produceth in our Minds the Phantasms of Colours, is
not so easie. And I shall not mingle Conjectures with Certainties.</p>

<p>Reviewing what I have written, I see the Discourse it self will lead
to divers Experiments sufficient for its Examination; and therefore I
shall not trouble you farther, than to describe one of those, which I
have already insinuated.</p>

<p>In a darkned Room, make a hole in the shut of a Window, whose
Diameter may conveniently be about a third part of an Inch, to admit a
convenient quantity of the Sun's Light. And there place a clear and
colourless Prism, to refract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
the entring Light towards the farther part of the Room; which, as I
said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured Image. Then place
a <i>Lens</i> of about three Foot Radius (suppose a broad Object-glass
of a three Foot Telescope,) at the distance of about four or five Foot
from thence, through which all those Colours may at once be transmitted,
and made by its Refraction to convene at a farther distance of about ten
or twelve Feet. If at that distance you intercept this Light with a
Sheet of white Paper, you will see the Colours converted into whiteness
again by being mingled. But it is requisite, that the <i>Prism</i> and
<i>Lens</i> be placed steady, and that the Paper, on which the Colours
are cast, be moved to and fro; for, by such motion, you will not only
find at what distance the whiteness is most perfect, but also see how
the Colours gradually convene, and vanish into whiteness; and
afterwards, having crossed one another in that place where they compound
whiteness, are again dissipated and severed, and in an inverted order
retain the same Colours, which they had before they entred the
Composition. You may also see, that, if any of the Colours at the
<i>Lens</i> be intercepted, the whiteness will be changed into the other
Colours. And therefore, that the Composition of whiteness be perfect,
care must be taken that none of the Colours fall besides the
<i>Lens</i>.</p>

<p>In the annexed Design, <i>Tab. 3. Fig. 2.</i> of this Experiment,
<i>ABC</i> expresseth the Prism set end-wise to sight, close by the hole
<i>F</i> of the Window <i>EG</i>. Its vertical Angle <i>ABC</i> may
conveniently be about 60 Degrees: <i>MN</i> designeth the <i>Lens</i>.
Its breadth 2½ or 3 Inches. <i>SF</i> one of the streight Lines, in
which difform Rays may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
be conceived to flow successively from the Sun. <i>FP</i>, and <i>FR</i>
two of those Rays unequally refracted, which the <i>Lens</i> makes to
converge towards <i>Q</i>, and after decussation to diverge again. And
<i>HI</i> the Paper, at divers distances, on which the Colours are
projected, which in <i>Q</i> constitute <i>Whiteness</i>, but are
<i>Red</i> and <i>Yellow</i> in <i>R</i>, <i>r</i>, and ρ, and
<i>Blue</i> and <i>Purple</i> in <i>P</i>, <i>p</i>, and π.</p>

<p>If you proceed further to try the impossibility of changing any
uncompounded Colour (which I have asserted in the third and thirteenth
Propositions,) 'tis requisite that the Room may be very dark, lest any
scattering light, mixing with the Colour, disturb and allay it, and
render it compound, contrary to the design of the Experiment. 'Tis also
requisite, that there be a perfecter separation of the Colours, than,
after the manner above described, can be made by the Refraction of one
single Prism; and how to make such farther separations, will scarce be
difficult to them, that consider the discovered Laws of Refractions. But
if trial shall be made with Colours not throughly separated, there must
be allowed changes proportionable to the mixture. Thus if compound
Yellow Light fall upon blue <i>Bise</i>, the Bise will not appear
perfectly yellow, but rather green, because there are in the yellow
mixture many Rays indued with green, and green being less remote from
the usual blue Colour of Bise than yellow, is the more copiously
reflected by it.</p>

<p>In like manner, if any one of the Prismatick Colours, suppose red, be
intercepted, on design to try the asserted impossibility of reproducing
that Colour out of the others which are pretermitted; 'tis necessary,
either that the Colours be very well parted before the red be
intercepted;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
or that, together with the red, the neighbouring Colours, into which any
red is secretly dispersed, (that is, the yellow, and perhaps green too)
be intercepted; or else, that allowance be made for the emerging of so
much red out of the yellow green, as may possibly have been diffused,
and scatteringly blended in those Colours. And if these things be
observed, the new Production of red, or any intercepted Colour, will be
found impossible.</p>

<p>This, I conceive, is enough for an Introduction to Experiments of
this kind; which if any of the <i>Royal Society</i> shall be so curious
as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what success:
That, if any thing seem to be defective, or to thwart this Relation, I
may have an opportunity of giving farther Direction about it, or of
acknowledging my Errors, if I have committed any.</p>

<p class="indent gap-above">Since the Publication of this Theory, some
Misunderstandings happening between a <strong>French</strong>
Philosopher at <strong>Paris</strong> and Mr. <strong>Newton</strong>,
he has endeavour'd to explain himself a little further in these Things,
according to the following Method.</p>

<h4><i>A farther Explanation of the same <strong>Theory</strong>.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>DEFINITIONS.</i></p>

<p>1. I call that Light Homogeneal, Similar, or Uniform, whose Rays are
equally refrangible.</p>

<p>2. And that Heterogeneal, whose Rays are unequally refrangible.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>, There are but three Affections of Light in which I have
observ'd its Rays to differ; <i>viz.</i> Refrangibility, Reflexibility,
and Colour; and those Rays which agree in Refrangibility, agree also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
in the other two, and therefore may well be defined Homogeneal;
especially since Men usually call those things Homogeneal, which are so
in all Qualities that come under their Knowledge, tho' in other
Qualities, that their Knowledge extends not to, there may possibly be
some Heterogeneity.</p>

<p>3. Those Colours I call Simple or Homogeneal, which are exhibited by
Homogeneal Light.</p>

<p>4. And those Compound or Heterogeneal, which are exhibited by
Heterogeneal Light.</p>

<p>5. Different Colours, I call, not only the more eminent Species, Red,
Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, but all other the minutest Gradations; much
after the same manner, that not only the more eminent Degrees in Musick,
but all the lead Gradations, are esteem'd different Sounds.</p>

<p class="center"><i>PROPOSITIONS.</i></p>

<p>1. The Sun's Light consists of Rays differing by indefinite Degrees
of Refrangibility.</p>

<p>2. Rays which differ in Refrangibility, when parted from one another,
do proportionally differ in the Colours which they exhibit. These Two
Propositions are Matter of Fact.</p>

<p>3. There are as many Simple or Homogeneal Colours, as Degrees of
Refrangibility. For to every Degree of Refrangibility belongs a
different Colour, by <i>Prop.</i> 2. and that Colour is Simple, by
<i>Def.</i> 1, and 3.</p>

<p>4. Whiteness, in all respects like that of the Sun's immediate Light,
and of all the usual Objects of our Senses, cannot be compounded of two
Simple Colours alone. For such a Composition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
must be made by Rays that have only two Degrees of Refrangibility, by
<i>Def.</i> 1 and 3. and therefore it cannot be like that of the Sun's
Light. by <i>Prop.</i> 1. nor, for the same Reason, like that of
ordinary white Objects.</p>

<p>5. Whiteness, in all respects, like that of the Sun's immediate
Light, cannot be compounded of Simple Colours without an indefinite
Variety of them. For to such a Composition, there are requisite Rays
endu'd with all the indefinite Degrees of Refrangibility, by
<i>Prop.</i> 1. And those infer as many Simple Colours, by <i>Def.</i> 1
and 3. and <i>Prop.</i> 2 and 3.</p>

<p>To make these a little plainer, I have added also the Propositions
that follow.</p>

<p>6. The Rays of Light do not act on one another, in passing through
the same Medium.</p>

<p>7. The Rays of Light suffer not any change of their Qualities from
Refraction.</p>

<p>8. Nor afterwards from the adjacent quiet <i>Medium</i>: These two
Propositions are manifest <i>de Facto</i> in Homogeneal Light, whose
Colour and Refrangibility is not at all changeable, either by
Refraction, or by the Contermination of a quiet <i>Medium</i>. And as
for Heterogeneal Light, it is but an Aggregate of several sorts of
Homogeneal Light, no one sort of which suffers any more alteration than
if it were alone; because the Rays act not on one another, by
<i>Prop.</i> 6. and therefore the Aggregate can suffer none. These two
Propositions also might be further proved apart, by Experiments too long
to be here described.</p>

<p>9. There can no Homogeneal Colours be reduced out of Light by
Refraction, which were not commixt in it before. Because by <i>Prop.</i>
7. and 8. Refraction changeth not the Qualities of the Rays, but only
separates those which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
divers Qualities, by means of their different Refrangibility.</p>

<p>10. The Sun's Light is an Aggregate of an indefinite variety of
Homogeneal Colours, by <i>Prop.</i> 1, 3, and 9. And hence it is, that I
call Homogeneal Colours also Primitive or Original. And thus much
concerning Colours.</p>

<p class="indent">For a further Illustration of this Doctrine, Mr.
<strong>Newton</strong>, in his Book of Opticks lately published, has by
undeniable Experiments explained most of the Principal Phænomena of
Light and Colours: To which we refer the Reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<h3>A Demonstration concerning the Motion of Light, communicated from
<strong>Paris</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">PHilosophers have been labouring for many Years to decide by some
Experiment, whether the Action of Light be conveyed in an instant to
distant Places, or whether it requireth time. M. <i>Romer</i>, of the
<i>Royal Academy</i> of Sciences, hath devised a way taken from the
Observations of the first Satellit of <i>Jupiter</i>, by which he
demonstrates, that for the distance of about 3000 Leagues, such as is
very near the bigness of the Diameter of the Earth, Light needs not one
Second of Time.</p>

<p>Let (in <i>Fig. 3. Plate 3.</i>) <i>A</i> be the <i>Sun</i>, <i>B</i>
<i>Jupiter</i>, <i>C</i> the first Satellit of <i>Jupiter</i>, which
enters into the shadow of <i>Jupiter</i>, to come out at <i>D</i>, and
let <i>EFGHKL</i> be the <i>Earth</i>, placed at divers distances from
<i>Jupiter</i>.</p>

<p>Now suppose the <i>Earth</i>, being in <i>L</i>, towards the second
Quadrature of <i>Jupiter</i>, hath seen the first Satellit, at the time
of its emersion, or issuing out of the shadow at <i>D</i>, and that
about 42½ Hours after (<i>viz.</i> after one Revolution of this
<i>Satellit</i>) the <i>Earth</i> being in <i>K</i>, do see it return'd
in <i>D</i>: It is manifest, that if the Light require time to traverse
the Interval <i>LK</i>, the <i>Satellit</i> will be seen return'd later
in <i>D</i>, than it would have been if the <i>Earth</i> had remained in
<i>L</i>. So that the Revolution of the <i>Satellit</i> being thus
observ'd by the Emersions, will be retarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
by so much time, as the Light shall have taken in passing from <i>L</i>
to <i>K</i>; and that on the contrary, in the other Quadrature
<i>FG</i>, where the <i>Earth</i> by approaching goes to meet the Light,
the Revolutions of the Emersions will appear to be shortned, by so much
as those of the Emersions had appear'd to be lengthned. And because 42½
Hours, which this <i>Satellit</i> very near takes to make one
Revolution, the distance between the <i>Earth</i> and <i>Jupiter</i>, in
both the Quadratures, varies at least 210 Diameters of the <i>Earth</i>:
It follows, that if for the Account of every Diameter of the
<i>Earth</i> there were required a Second of Time, the Light would take
3½ Minutes for each of the Intervals <i>GF</i>, <i>KL</i>; which would
cause near half a quarter of an Hour between two Revolutions of the
first <i>Satellit</i>, one observ'd in <i>FG</i>, and the other in
<i>KL</i>, whereas there is not observed any sensible difference.</p>

<p>Yet doth it not follow hence, that Light demands no time. For after
M. <i>Romer</i> had examin'd the thing more nearly, he found that what
was not sensible in two Revolutions, became very considerable in many
being taken together; and that, for Example, forty Revolutions observed
on the side <i>F</i>, might be sensibly shorter, than forty others
observ'd in any place of the <i>Zodiack</i> where <i>Jupiter</i> may be
met with; and that in proportion of Twenty two for the whole Interval of
<i>HE</i>, which is the double of the Interval that is from hence to the
Sun.</p>

<p>The necessity of this new Equation of the Retardment of Light, is
establish'd by all the Observations that have been made in the <i>Royal
Academy</i>, and in the <i>Observatory</i>, for the space of eight
Years; and it hath been lately confirmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
by the Emersion of the first <i>Satellit</i> observ'd at <i>Paris</i>,
the <i>9th</i> of <i>November</i> last, at 5 a-clock 35' 45" at Night,
10 Minutes later than it was to be expected, by deducting it from those
that had been observ'd in the Month of <i>August</i>, when the
<i>Earth</i> was much nearer to <i>Jupiter</i>; which M. <i>Romer</i>
had predicted to the said Academy from the beginning of
<i>September</i>.</p>

<p>But to remove all doubt, that this Inequality is caused by the
Retardment of the Light, he demonstrates, that it cannot come from any
Excentricity, or other Cause of those that are commonly alledged to
explicate the Irregularities of the <i>Moon</i>, and the other Planets;
though he be well aware, that the first <i>Satellit</i> of
<i>Jupiter</i> was Excentrick; and that, besides his Revolutions were
advanced or retarded, according as <i>Jupiter</i> did approach to or
recede from the Sun; as also, that the Revolutions of the <i>Primum
Mobile</i> were unequal: Yet, saith he, these three last Causes of
Inequality do not hinder the first from being manifest.</p>

<h3>An introductory <strong>Essay</strong> to the Doctrine of
<strong>Sounds</strong>, containing some Proposals for the improvement
of <strong>Acousticks</strong>; As it was presented to the
<strong>Dublin Society</strong>, Nov. 12. 1683, by the Right Reverend
Father in God <strong>Narcissus</strong> Lord Bishop of
<strong>Ferns</strong> and <strong>Leighlin</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">BEing to treat of the Doctrine of <i>Sounds</i>, I
hold it convenient to premise something in the general, concerning this
Theory; which may serve at once to ingage your Attention, and excuse my
Pains, when I shall have recommended them, as bestow'd on a Subject not
altogether useless and unfruitful.</p>

<p>And for this purpose I shall omit to speak any thing of the
<i>Excellency</i> of the Matter in Hand; though it might be celebrated
by Arguments drawn from several Topicks, and particularly from this,
that new Discoveries and Improvements may be made, both as to the
<i>Generation</i>, <i>Propagation</i> and <i>Reception</i> of Sounds
into the Sense; which, in a peculiar manner agrees to this, above the
Object of any other Sense whatsoever. I shall, I say, omit these things,
and apply my self wholly to the <i>Usefulness</i> of the Theory, that we
are now falling upon, which I think cannot better be discovered, than by
making a comparison 'twixt the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
Senses of <i>Seeing</i> and <i>Hearing</i>, as to their Improvements. I
mean, by shewing, that this latter of <i>Hearing</i> is capable of all
those improvements which the Sense of <i>Seeing</i> has receiv'd from
Art, besides many more advantages that the <i>Ear</i> may enjoy, by the
help of our Doctrine, above the <i>Eye</i>; all which moreover will be
of as great benefit to Mankind, as any thing that <i>Opticks</i> have
yet discover'd, if not of greater; which, with some other pre-eminencies
that it has upon another Score, will happily render <i>Acousticks</i>
the nobler Science of the two.</p>

<p>In order to the making good what I but now premised of the Comparison
of these two Faculties of <i>Seeing</i> and <i>Hearing</i>, as to their
Improvements, I observe;</p>

<p>That <i>Vision</i> is threefold, <i>Direct</i>, <i>Refracted</i>, and
<i>Reflex'd</i>; answerable whereunto we have <i>Opticks</i>,
<i>Dioptricks</i>, and <i>Catoptricks</i>.</p>

<p>In like manner <i>Hearing</i> may be divided into <i>Direct</i>,
<i>Refracted</i> and <i>Reflex'd</i>; whereto answer three parts of our
Doctrine of <i>Acousticks</i>, which are yet nameless, unless we call
them <i>Acousticks</i>, <i>Diacousticks</i>, and <i>Catacousticks</i>,
or (in another Sense, but to as good Purpose) <i>Phonicks</i>,
<i>Diaphonicks</i>, and <i>Cataphonicks</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">I. Direct Vision has been improv'd two ways, <i>ex
parte</i> Objecti, and <i>ex parte</i> Organi <i>vel</i> Medii.</p>

<p>1. <i>Ex parte Objecti</i>, Direct Vision has receiv'd advantages by
the Arts of <i>Producing</i>, <i>Conserving</i> and <i>Imitating
Light</i> and <i>Colours</i>, which are the Objects of Vision.</p>

<p>1. For the Art of <i>Producing Light</i>, we have the Frication of
all hard Bodies that beget Fire; especially of the Flint and Steel; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
instead of the Flint, most hard Stones (as well as the Cane) may be us'd
to the same effect, as upon trial I have found. Add hereto the lately
invented <i>Phosphorus</i>, which is a new and admirable way of
producing a <i>Lucid Substance</i> by Art, out of a Body in itself not
<i>Lucid</i>; and therefore may not unfitly be term'd an <i>Artificial
production</i> of <i>Light</i>.</p>

<p>And then of the Art of <i>Conserving Light</i>, the <i>Lapis
Bononiensis</i> is a notable Instance; and so happily were the
<i>Sepulchral Lamps</i> of the Ancients.</p>

<p>2. As to <i>Colours</i>, 'tis the greatest part of the Art of
<i>Dying</i> to be able to make and fix (that is preserve) them; and the
<i>Painters</i> and <i>Limners</i> will own it to be no small part of
their Skill to be able well to <i>Mix</i> (that is, in effect, to
<i>Generate</i>) <i>Colours</i>.</p>

<p>3. For <i>Imitation of Light</i> and <i>Colours</i>, 'tis well known
how far <i>Perspective</i> with the Art of <i>Limning</i> and
<i>Shadowing</i> have gone therein, which all tend some way to the
Advance or Improvement of <i>Direct Vision</i>.</p>

<p>Add to all these, That <i>a due Application of Light to the
Object</i> renders it Visible, if it were not so before; as appears from
a dark Room illuminated; or else makes it better and more truly
discernable by the Sense of <i>Seeing</i>, if before it might have been
discern'd.</p>

<p>Hence the same <i>Colour</i>, in a diverse Light, will appear
different, and no <i>Picture</i> can well be discern'd or judg'd of but
by its true Light. Besides, the <i>Limner</i> will assure you, that he
can hardly make true Work, or hit the Air of a Face exactly, unless he
draw by a <i>North-Light</i>, by reason of the steadiness of that, and
the uncertainty of all other Lights whatsoever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
Which things shew, that the <i>Art of duly applying Light to the
Object</i> does very much help and improve Vision. So also does the due
placing of the <i>Object</i>, as to <i>Height</i> and <i>Distance</i>.
But to enumerate all things that help <i>Direct Vision</i>, would be
infinite.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ex parte Organi vel Medii</i>, Direct Vision has been improv'd
by making use of a <i>Tube</i>, without Glasses, or a Man's clos'd Hand,
to look thro'; which admitting into the <i>Eye</i> only the principal
Rays, that come directly from the Object, do very much strengthen and
clear the Sight, by excluding all the Collateral Rays, that crouding
into the Eye, together with the direct ones, would confound and disturb
it, partly by mixing and interfering with the direct Rays, and partly
(or rather chiefly) by too much enlightning the fund of the Eye, wherein
Vision is truly (tho' then imperfectly) made.</p>

<p>On this is founded the Art of making <i>Spectacles</i> without
Glasses; (as well as <i>Tubes</i>) which is done by putting into the
Glass-holes (instead of Glasses) two short <i>Tubes</i> of between three
and four Inches long (for their length is to be vary'd according to the
Age or Eye of the Beholder, and so also is the Diameter of the extream
ends) which <i>Tubes</i> being made of <i>Spanish Leather</i> (or
Past-board, or some such like Matter) and black'd on the inside, are so
to be placed, as that the visual Rays, receiv'd thro' them, may meet in
one point (or rather issue out from one Point) of the Object standing at
such a due distance, as the Person may clearly and distinctly see it, or
according to his length of Sight (as ABC, in the 4th <i>Fig. Tab.</i>
3.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
And these <i>Spectacles</i> may be suppos'd better for preserving the
Sight, than the ordinary ones with Glasses, because they represent the
Object more naturally, and withal more clearly and distinctly to the
Eye, than the other, whose refracted Rays being collected together with
the right ones in the Glasses, do somewhat confound good Vision, as
before: Especially if the visive Power be strong enough to be
sufficiently determin'd by the right Rays alone.</p>

<p>For I speak now of preserving a good Eye by these Spectacles, which
holds in proportion true also of a bad one. Because those Rays (both
right and refracted) being collected and brought so near the Eye
(whether good or bad) as the Spectacles are usually plac'd, do too much
affect it, both by their own brightness, and also by the brightness of
the Colours of the Object (when they are bright) which is brought very
near also; whereby the Eye is dazl'd and confounded, unless there be a
strong attention and <i>conatus</i> of the Spirits, whereto the bright
Rays do certainly engage them, which of necessity weakens Vision,
especially if these Glass-spectacles be much us'd.</p>

<p>Wherefore the now describ'd new Tube-spectacles, contributing so much
to the help and preservation of Sight, may well be counted an
improvement of <i>Direct Vision</i>, because they convey the Rays to the
Eye without any kind of Refraction whatsoever. Seeing the same Object
also through various holes, plac'd at certain distances, does somewhat
alter Vision; but of this perhaps more hereafter.</p>

<p>Now as <i>Direct Vision</i> has thus been improved, so likewise
<i>Direct Hearing</i> partly has already receiv'd, and partly may by the
Doctrine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
whereof we are treating, (if well cultivated) farther receive as great
and notable Improvements, both <i>ex parte</i> Objecti, and <i>ex
parte</i> Organi <i>vel</i> Medii.</p>

<p>1. As to the <i>Object</i> of Hearing, which is Sound, improvement
has been and may be made, both as to the <i>Begetting</i>, and as to the
<i>Conveying</i> and <i>Propagating</i> (which is a kind of
<i>Conserving</i>) of Sounds.</p>

<p>1. As to the <i>Begetting</i> of Sounds. The Art of imitating any
Sound, whether by <i>Speaking</i> (that is pronouncing) any kind of
Language, (which really is an Art, and the <i>Art of Speaking</i>,
perhaps one of the greatest) or by <i>Whistling</i>, or by
<i>Singing</i> (which are allow'd Arts) or by <i>Hollowing</i> or
<i>Luring</i> (which the Huntsman or Faulkner would have to be an Art
also) or by imitating with the Mouth (or otherwise) the Voice of any
Animal, as of <i>Quails</i>, <i>Cats</i>, and the like; or by
<i>representing</i> any Sound begotten by the Collision of Solid Bodies,
or after any other manner; these are all <i>Improvements</i> of
<i>Direct Hearing</i>, and may be improv'd.</p>

<p>Moreover the Skill to make all sorts of <i>Musical Instruments</i>,
both Ancient and Modern, whether <i>Wind</i> Instruments or
<i>String'd</i>, or of any other sort, whereof there are very many (as
<i>Drums</i>, <i>Bells</i>, the <i>Systrum</i> of the <i>Egyptians</i>,
and the like) that beget (and not only propagate) Sounds; the Skill of
making these, I say, is an Art, that has as much improv'd <i>Direct
Hearing</i>, as an Harmonious Sound exceeds a single and rude one, that
is, an immusical <i>Tone</i>; which Art is yet capable of farther
improvement. And I do hope, that by the Rules, which may happily be laid
down concerning the <i>Nature</i>, <i>Propagation</i> and
<i>Proportion</i>, or <i>Adapting</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
of Sounds, a way may be found out, both to improve <i>Musical
Instruments</i> already in use, and to invent new ones, that shall be
more sweet and luscious, than any yet known. Besides that, by the same
means <i>Instruments</i> may be made, that shall imitate any Sound in
Nature, that is not Articulate, be it of Bird, Beast, or what thing else
soever.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Conveying</i> and <i>Propagating</i> (which is a kind of
<i>Conserving</i>) of Sounds, is much help'd by <i>duly placing the
Sonorous Body</i>, and also by the <i>Medium</i>.</p>

<p>For if the Medium be <i>Thin</i> and <i>Quiescent</i>, and the
Sounding Body <i>plac'd conveniently</i>, the Sound will be easily and
regularly propagated, and mightily conserv'd. I say,</p>

<p>1. If the <i>Medium be Thin and Quiescent</i>, because it otherwise
causes a <i>Refracted Sound</i>, of which afterwards. Hence in a
<i>still Evening</i>, or the <i>dead of the Night</i> (when the Wind
ceases) a Sound is better sent out, and to a greater distance than
otherwise, tho' much of this may be ascrib'd to its <i>Refraction</i>
also.</p>

<p>2. I say, that the <i>Sonorous Body must be plac'd conveniently</i>,
near a <i>Smooth Wall</i>, near <i>Water</i>, or <i>a Plain</i>, whose
Surface is even.</p>

<p>1. Near a <i>Smooth Wall</i>, either Plain or Arch'd (Cycloidically
or Elliptically, rather than otherwise, tho' a Circular or any Arch will
do, but not so well.)</p>

<p>Hence in a Church, the nearer the Preacher stands to the Wall (and
certainly 'tis much the best way to place Pulpits near the Wall) the
better is he heard, especially by those who stand near the Wall also,
though at a greater distance from the Pulpit; those at the remotest end
of the Church, by laying their Ears somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
close to the Wall, may hear him easier than those in the middle.</p>

<p>Hence also do arise <i>Whispering Places</i>. For the Voice being
apply'd to one end of an Arch, easily rowls to the other. And indeed
were the <i>Motion</i> and <i>Propagation</i> of Sounds but rightly
understood, 'twould be no hard matter to contrive <i>Whispering
Places</i> of infinite variety and use. And perhaps there could be no
better or more pleasant hearing a <i>Consort of Musick</i> than at such
a place as this, where the Sounds rowling along together, before they
come to the Ear, must needs consolidate and imbody into one; which
becomes a true composition of Sounds, and is the very Life and Soul of
Consort.</p>

<p>2. If the Sonorous Body be plac'd near <i>Water</i>, the Sound will
easily be convey'd, yet mollified; as Experience teacheth us from a Ring
of <i>Bells</i> near a River, and a great <i>Gun</i> shot off at Sea,
which yet differ much in the strength, and softness and continuance, or
propagation of their Sounds, from the same at Land, where the Sound is
more harsh and more perishing, or much sooner decays.</p>

<p>3. In a <i>Plain</i> a Voice may be heard at a far greater distance
than in uneven Ground.</p>

<p>The <i>Reason</i> of all which last nam'd <i>Phænomena</i> is the
same; because the Sonorous Air meeting with little or no resistance upon
a <i>Plane</i> (much less upon an Arch'd) smooth Superficies, easily
rowls along it, without being let or hinder'd in its Motion, and
consequently without having its parts disfigured, and put into another
kind of Revolution, than what they had at the first begetting of the
Sound. Which is the true cause of its <i>Preservation</i> or
<i>Progression</i>, and fails much when the Air passes over an uneven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
Surface, according to the degrees of its inequality, and somewhat also,
when it passes over the plain Superficies of a Body that is hard and
resisting.</p>

<p>Wherefore the smooth Top of the Water (by reason of its yielding to
the Arch'd Air, and gently arising again with a kind of Resurge, like to
<i>Elasticity</i>, tho' it be not so, by which Resurge it quickens and
hastens the motion of the Air rowling over it, and by its yielding
preserves it in its Arch'd Cycloidical or Elliptical Figure) the smooth
Top of the Water, I say, for these Reasons, and by these Means, conveys
a Sound more entire, and to a greater distance than the plain Surface of
a piece of Ground, a Wall, or any other Solid Body whatever, can do.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Speaking Trumpet</i>, by which a Voice may be convey'd
to a considerable distance, I refer its consideration to that of
<i>Refracted Sounds</i>, or <i>Refracted Audition</i>.</p>

<p>Thus much of the Improvements of Hearing, that respect its
<i>Object</i>, which is <i>Sound</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Organ</i> and <i>Medium</i> are to be consider'd. And,
1. The <i>Organ</i>, which is the <i>Ear</i>, is helpt much by placing
it near a Wall (especially at one end of an Arch, the Sound being
begotten at the other) or near the Surface of Water, or of the Earth,
along which the Sounds are most easily and naturally convey'd, as was
before declar'd. And 'tis incredible how far a Sound made upon the Earth
(by the trampling of a Troop of Horses, for Example) may be heard in a
still Night, if a Man lays his Ear close to the Ground in a large
Plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
<i>Otacousticks</i> here come in for helping the <i>Ear</i>; which may
be so contriv'd (by a right understanding the <i>Progression of
Sounds</i>, which is the principal thing to be known for the due
regulating all such kinds of Instruments) as that the Sound might enter
the Ear without any Refraction, but as now they are generally made I
refer them to <i>Refracted Audition</i>.</p>

<p>2. As to the <i>Medium</i>, I know not how that, by any contrivance
of Art, can advantage <i>Direct Hearing</i>, otherwise than I have
declar'd already in the propagation or conveyance of Sounds, though to
the Refracting or Reflecting of them it may very much conduce; of which
presently.</p>

<p>And so I have done with the first part of my present undertaking,
which is the <i>Comparison of Direct Vision and Audition</i>, as to
their Improvements from Art. The rest follow. Wherefore,</p>

<p class="gap-above">II. Concerning <i>Refracted Vision</i> and its
Comparison, I observe, That <i>Refracted Vision</i> is always made <i>Ex
parte Medii</i>, as <i>Reflected</i> is <i>ex parte Objecti</i>. And
therefore, though <i>Direct Vision</i> may be help'd <i>ex parte
Objecti, Medii vel Organi</i>, yet <i>Refracted</i> can be improv'd only
<i>ex parte Medii</i>, and <i>Reflected</i> <i>ex parte Corporis
oppositi</i> alone. Unless it be in a mixt or compound Vision, that is
<i>Refracto-Reflext</i>, when the reflext Rays pass to the Eye through a
refracting Medium, such as the <i>Medium Internum</i>, contain'd in the
Body of the Eye, always is. So that in truth, all Vision is
<i>Refracted</i> by an internal Refraction made in <i>ipso Oculo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
And all that I have spoken of <i>Vision</i> holds true of <i>Hearing</i>
also, both <i>Refracted</i> and <i>Reflext</i>, and therefore need not
be repeated.</p>

<p><i>Refracted Vision</i> arises from the different <i>Density</i>,
<i>Figure</i>, and <i>Magnitude</i> of the Medium, which is somewhat
alter'd also by the diverse incidence of the visible Rays. And so it is
in <i>Refracted Hearing</i>, all these Causes concur to its Production,
and some others to be hereafter consider'd.</p>

<p>Now as any Object (a Man for example) seen through a thicken'd Air,
by <i>Refraction</i> appears greater than really he is: So likewise a
<i>Sound</i>, heard through the same thicken'd part of the
<i>Atmosphere</i>, will be considerably vary'd from what it would seem
to be, if heard through a thinner Medium.</p>

<p>And this I call a <i>Refracted Sound</i>: But what this Refraction of
Sound is, and how caus'd, may hereafter be discuss'd, when the Nature,
and Motion, or Progression of Sounds are well stated.</p>

<p>For the Improvement of <i>Refracted Vision</i> artificial Instruments
have been made, by grinding or blowing Glasses, into a certain Figure,
and placing them at due distances, whereby the Object may be (as 'twere)
enabled to send forth its Rays more vigorously, and the Visive Faculty
impower'd the better to receive them. And thus also Instruments may be
contriv'd for the assisting both the <i>Sonorous Body</i>, to send forth
its Sound more strongly, and the <i>Acoustick Faculty</i>, to receive
and discern it more easily and clearly. <i>For</i>,</p>

<p>1. As a fine <i>Glass Bubble</i>, fill'd with clear Water, and placed
before a burning Candle or Lamp, does help it to dart forth its Rays to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
prodigious Length and Brightness: So an <i>Instrument</i> may be
invented, that apply'd to the Mouth (or any Sonorous Body) shall send
forth the Voice distinctly to as prodigious a Distance and Loudness.</p>

<p>For if the <i>Stentoro-phonecon</i> (which is but a rude and
unartificial Instrument) does such great feats, what might be done with
one compos'd according to the Rules of Art? whose make should comply
with the Laws of <i>Sonorous Motion</i> (which that does not) and
therefore not so much <i>Refract</i>, as to alter and confound the
<i>Tone</i> of the <i>Voice</i> and Words (as that somewhat does.)</p>

<p>Now of what use such an Instrument might be for speaking clearly and
articulately at a distance (and that without altering the Tone of the
Voice) whether it be at Sea or at Land (but especially at Sea in
tempestuous Weather and in the Night) is obvious to any Man to
conceive.</p>

<p>2. As Instruments have been invented to help the Eye, So likewise are
there some, and more such there may be, for the Ear.</p>

<p><i>For</i>,</p>

<p>1. As <i>Spectacles</i> and other <i>Glasses</i> are made to help the
<i>Purblind</i> and weak <i>Eyes</i>, to see at any competent distance:
So there are <i>Otacousticks</i> (and better may be made) to help weak
<i>Ears</i> to hear at a reasonable distance also. Which would be as
great a help to the infirmity of Old Age, as the other invention of
Spectacles is, and perhaps greater; forasmuch as the Hearing what's
spoken is of more daily use and concern to such Men, then to be able to
<i>read Books</i> or to <i>view Pictures</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
2. As <i>Perspective-Glasses</i> and Telescopes help the Eye to see
Objects at a very great distance, which otherwise would not be
discernable; in like manner may a sort of <i>Otacousticks</i> be so
contriv'd, as that they shall receive in <i>Sounds</i> made at a very
great distance also, but with so much advantage, that the Ear shall be
able to hear them, which otherwise would have been <i>inaudible</i>.</p>

<p>And these <i>Otacousticks</i> in some respects would be of greater
use than <i>Perspectives</i>. For whereas at Land <i>Perspectives</i>
are many times render'd almost useless, by the interposition of Woods
and Mountains, which hinder the Sight from reaching very far: Our
<i>Otacousticks</i> would, notwithstanding these Obstacles, take in a
Sound made some Leagues off. Which might be of notable use in the time
of War, for discovering the Enemy at a good distance, when he marches or
lyes incamp'd behind a Mountain or Wood, or any such place of
shelter.</p>

<p>Yea, even at Sea also, where <i>Perspectives</i> are of most use, by
reason of the plainess of the Surface of the Water; yet sometimes there
<i>Otacousticks</i> may be of more benefit, when in dark hazy Weather
the Air is too thick, or in Stormy Tempestuous Weather the Waves arise
too high for the <i>Perspective</i> to be made use of.</p>

<p>But, whether at Sea or Land, <i>Perspectives</i> become altogether
insignificant in the Night-time (unless it be for viewing the Stars)
which is the chief time for using <i>Otacousticks</i>; as it is
generally, for Soldiers to take their March, when they would surprise
their Enemies.</p>

<p>And therefore this sort of <i>Otacousticks</i> have then their chief
use, when <i>Perspectives</i> are of no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
use at all; besides that they may be imploy'd in the Day-time, as well
as <i>Perspectives</i>, whence they may (not unfitly) be term'd <i>the
most useful Instrument</i> of the two.</p>

<p>3. As <i>Microscopes</i> or <i>Magnifying-Glasses</i> help the Eye to
see near Objects, that by reason of their smallness were
<i>Invisible</i> before; which Objects they Magnify to a strange
greatness: So <i>Microphones</i> or <i>Micracousticks</i>, that is
Magnifying Ear Instruments, may be contriv'd after that manner, that
they shall render the most minute Sound in nature distinctly audible, by
Magnifying it to an unconceivable loudness.</p>

<p>By the help hereof we may hear the different Cries and Tones, as well
as by <i>Microscopes</i> see the divers Shapes and Figures of the
smallest Animals.</p>

<p>4. As by <i>Polyscopes</i> or <i>Multiplying-Glasses</i>, one thing
is represented to the Eye as many, whether in the same or different
Shapes (for so Multiplying-Glasses may be contriv'd:) So by a
<i>Polyphone</i> or <i>Polyacoustick</i> well order'd, one <i>Sound</i>
may be heard as many, either of the same or a different Note. Insomuch,
that who uses this Instrument, he shall, at the Sound of a single Viol,
seem to hear a whole Consort and all true Harmony. By which means this
Instrument has much the advantage of the <i>Polyscope</i>.</p>

<p>And thus much may suffice for comparing the Improvements made upon
<i>Refracted Seeing and Hearing</i>; I call it <i>Refracted Hearing</i>,
because made through a <i>Medium</i>, viz. thick Air, or an Instrument,
through which the Sound passing is broken or refracted.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
III. <i>Reflected Vision</i> has been improv'd by the Invention of
<i>Looking-glasses</i> and <i>Polished Metals</i>, whether <i>Plane</i>,
<i>Concave</i>, or <i>Convex</i>; and these two last, either
<i>Spherical</i>, <i>Oval</i>, <i>Cylindrical</i>, <i>Conical</i>,
<i>Hyperbolical</i>, or of several other shapes; all which cause a
different Reflection, and vary the <i>Phænomena</i>.</p>

<p>Thus also <i>Reflext Audition</i>, made by <i>Ecchoes</i>, may be
improv'd, by contriving several sorts of <i>Artificial Ecchoes</i>; as
'tis no hard matter to do in almost any place.</p>

<p>For (speaking in the general) <i>Any Sound, falling directly or
obliquely upon any dense Body, of a smooth (whether Plane or Arch'd)
Superficies, is beat back again and reflected, or does eccho more or
less</i>.</p>

<p>I say (1.) <i>falling directly or obliquely</i>; because, if the
Sound be sent out and propagated parallel to the Surface of the <i>Dense
Body</i>, or be made so <i>far off</i> and so <i>weak</i>, that it
cannot reach it, there will be no Reflection of Sound, no
<i>Eccho</i>.</p>

<p>I say (2.) <i>upon a Body of a smooth Superficies</i>; because if the
Surface of the <i>Corpus Obstans</i> be uneven, the Air by reverberation
will be put out of its regular Motion, and the Sound thereby broken and
extinguish'd: So that tho' in this case also the Air be beaten back
again, yet Sound is not reflected, nor is there any Eccho.</p>

<p>I say (3.) <i>it does eccho more or less</i>, to shew, that when all
things are, as is before describ'd, there is still an Ecchoing, though
it be not always heard; either because the <i>direct Sound</i> is too
weak to be beaten quite back again to him that made it; or that it does
return home to him, but so weak, that without the help of a good
<i>Otacoustick</i>, it cannot be discern'd; or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
he stands in a wrong place, to receive the reflected Sound, which passes
over his head, under his Feet, or to one side of him; which therefore
may be heard by a Man standing in that place, where the reflected Sound
will come, provided no interpos'd Body does intercept it; but not by
him, that first made it.</p>

<p>I shall further make out the comparison 'twixt <i>Reflex'd Vision</i>
and <i>Audition</i>, by these following <i>Propositions</i>.</p>

<p>1. As a <i>Plain Speculum</i> reflects the <i>Object</i> in its due
<i>Dimensions</i> and <i>Colours</i>; allowing for their difference of
appearance, according to their distance: So a <i>Plane Corpus
Obstans</i> reflects the <i>Sound</i> back in its due <i>Tone</i> and
<i>Loudness</i>; if allowance be likewise made for the proportionable
decrease of the Sound, according to its distance.</p>

<p>2. As a <i>Convex Speculum</i> reflects the <i>Object less</i>, but
somewhat <i>brighter</i> or clearer: So a <i>Convex Corpus Obstans</i>
repels the Sound (insensibly) <i>smaller</i>; but somewhat
<i>quicker</i> (though <i>weaker</i>) than otherwise it would be.</p>

<p>3. As a <i>Concave Speculum</i> reflects the Object <i>bigger</i>,
more obscure and <i>Inverted</i>: So a <i>Concave Corpus Obstans</i>
ecchoes back the Sound (insensibly) <i>bigger</i>, <i>slower</i> (though
<i>stronger</i>) and also <i>inverted</i>; but never according to the
order of Words. Nor do I think it possible for the Art of Man to
contrive a <i>Single Eccho</i>, that shall invert the Sound, and repeat
backwards; because then the Words last spoken, that is, which do last
occur to the <i>Corpus Obstans</i>, must first be repell'd; which cannot
be: For where, in the mean time, should the first Words hang, and be
conceal'd, or lie dormant? Or how, after such a pause, be reviv'd and
animated again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
into Motion? Yet in complicated or <i>Compound Ecchoes</i>, where many
receive from one another, I know not whether something that way may not
be done.</p>

<p>From the determinate <i>Concavity</i> or <i>Archedness</i> of these
reflecting Bodies, it comes to pass, that some of them, from a certain
distance or posture, will eccho back but one determinate Note, and from
no other place will they reverberate any; because of the undue Position
of the sounding Body. Such an one (as I remember) is the Vault in
<i>Merton</i> College in <i>Oxford</i>.</p>

<p>4. As a <i>Speculum</i> takes in and reflects more of its Object,
when plac'd at a great distance from it, than when nearer; because it
reflects according to the apparent Magnitude of the Body at such a
distance, which is less: So also the <i>Ecchoing Body</i>, being remov'd
farther off, reflects more of the Sound, than when nearer. And this is
the reason, why some Ecchoes repeat but one Syllable, some one Word, and
some many.</p>

<p>5. As <i>Specula's</i> may be so plac'd, that reflecting one upon or
into the other, either directly or obliquely, one Object shall appear
many; as in Sir <i>Samuel Moreland</i>'s Glass-room: After the same
manner <i>Ecchoing Bodies</i> may be so contriv'd and plac'd, as that
reflecting the Sound from one to the other, either directly and
mutually, or obliquely and by Succession, out of one Sound shall many
Ecchoes be begotten; which in the first case will be all together, and
somewhat involv'd or swallow'd up of each other, and thereby confus'd
(as a Face in Looking-glasses obverted) in the other they will be
distinct, separate, and succeeding one another; as most <i>multiple
Ecchoes</i> do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
Moreover a <i>Multiple-Eccho</i> may be made, by so placing the
<i>Ecchoing Bodies</i>, at unequal distances, that they reflect all one
way, and not one on the other; by which means a manifold successive
Sound will be heard (not without astonishment) one Clap of the hands
like many, one Ha, like a laughter, one single Word like many of the
same Tone and Accent, and so one Viol like many of the same kind
imitating each other.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as <i>Specula's</i> may be so order'd, that by
Reflection they shall make one single thing appear many different
things; as one single Man to seem many Men, differing as to Shape and
Complexion (or a company of Men) which I think Sir <i>Samuel
Moreland</i>'s Contrivance does not: So may <i>Ecchoing Bodies</i> also
be order'd, that from any one Sound given, they shall produce many
Ecchoes, different both as to their <i>Tone</i> and <i>Intension</i>.
(The ground whereof has elsewhere been laid down in a Treatise
concerning the <i>Sympathy of Lute-strings</i>.)</p>

<p>By this means a <i>Musical Room</i> may be so contriv'd, that not
only one Instrument, play'd on in it shall seem many of the same
<i>sort</i> and <i>size</i>; but even a Consort of (somewhat) different
ones; only by placing certain <i>Ecchoing Bodies</i> so, as that any
Note (play'd) shall be return'd by them in 3<i>ds</i>, 5<i>ths</i>, and
8<i>ths</i>, which is possible to be done otherwise than was mention'd
before in <i>Refracted Audition</i>.</p>

<p>I have now done with my <i>Comparison</i> of the two Noblest
<i>Senses</i>, and <i>Sciences</i>, as to their <i>Improvements</i>;
wherein I have been thus large, that I might give you a little prospect
into the <i>Excellency</i> and <i>Usefulness</i> of <i>Acousticks</i>;
and that thereby I might excite all that hear me, to bend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
their Thoughts towards the making of Experiments for the compleating
this (yet very imperfect, tho' noble) Science; a <i>Specimen</i> whereof
I will give you in three <i>Problems</i>, and then present you with the
<i>Semiplane</i> of an <i>Acoustick or Phonical Sphere</i>, as an
Attempt to explicate the great <i>Principle</i> in this Science, which
is <i>The Progression of Sounds</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>The Problems are these:</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Sonum intendere quousque velis</i>; or, <i>Datum sonum ad datum
gradum intendere</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sonum extendere quousque velis</i>; or, <i>Datum sonum ad datum
distantiam extendere seu propagare</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sonum transire ab extremo ad extremum</i> &amp; <i>non per
Medium</i>.</p>

<p>1. The first is, <i>To make the least Sound</i> (by the help of
Instruments) <i>as loud as the greatest</i>; a whisper to become as loud
as the shot of a Cannon.</p>

<p>By the help of this <i>Problem</i>, the most minute Sounds in Nature
may be clearly and distinctly heard.</p>

<p>2. The second is, <i>To propagate any</i> (the least) <i>Sound to the
greatest distance</i>.</p>

<p>By the help hereof any Sound may be convey'd to any, and therefore
heard at any distance, (I must add, within a certain, tho' very large
Sphere.)</p>

<p>Moreover, by this means, a <i>Weather-cock</i> may be so contriv'd,
as that with an ordinary blast of Wind it shall cry (or whistle) loud
enough to be heard many Leagues: Which happily may be found of some use,
not only for <i>Pilots</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
in mighty tempestuous Weather, when <i>light Houses</i> are render'd
almost useless, but also for the measuring the strength of Winds, if
allowance be made for their different moisture. For I conceive, that the
more dry any Wind is, the louder it will whistle <i>cæteris paribus</i>;
I say, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, because, besides the strength and dryness
of Winds or Breath, there are a great many other things (hereafter to be
considered) that concur to the increase or magnifying of Sounds,
begotten by them in an Instrument exposed to their Violence, or blown
into.</p>

<p>3. The third <i>Problem</i>, is, <i>That a Sound may be convey'd from
one extreme to the other</i> (or from one distant place to another)
<i>so as not to be heard in the middle</i>.</p>

<p>By the help of this <i>Problem</i> a Man may talk to his Friend at a
very considerable distance, so that those in the middle space shall hear
nothing of what passed betwixt them.</p>

<p class="center large">FIG. V. TAB. III.</p>

<p class="center large"><i>Semiplanum Sphæræ Phonicæ seu
Acousticæ.</i></p>

<p>You are to conceive that (rude) <i>Semiplane</i>, as parallel to the
<i>Horizon</i>: For if it be perpendicular thereunto, I suppose the
upper extremity will be no longer <i>Circular</i>, but
<i>Hyperbolical</i>, and the lower part of it suited to a greater Circle
of the Earth. So that the whole <i>Phonical</i> Sphere (if I may so call
it) will be a solid <i>Hyperbola</i>, standing upon a <i>Concave
Spherical</i> Base. I speak this concerning <i>Sounds</i> made (as
usually they are) nigh the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
Earth, and whose Sonorous <i>Medium</i> has a free passage every way.
For if they are generated high in the Air, or directed one way, the case
will be different; which is partly design'd in the inequality of that
Draught.</p>

<h3>A Discourse concerning the Modern <strong>Theory</strong> of
<strong>Generation</strong>, by Dr. <strong>George Garden</strong> of
<strong>Aberdeen</strong>, being part of a Letter to Dr. <strong>William
Musgrave</strong>, L. L. D. Reg. Soc. S. and by him communicated the
Royal Society.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE Subject I pitch upon, is that of the Formation of
Animals. You know how wide and unsatisfying Men's Conjectures were upon
this Head, until this Age, in which first the deservedly Famous Dr.
<i>Harvey</i> discovered the proper place of the Formation of the Chick
in the <i>Cicatricula</i> of the Egg, and the Formation of the Parts so
far as was discernable by the naked Eye; and after him
<i>Malpighius</i>, by the help of exact Glasses, observ'd the first
Rudiments of it there, both before and after Incubation: And <i>R. de
Graef</i>, and others, having upon many Observations concluded, that the
<i>Testes Fœminei</i> were the Ovaries of Females, and consequently that
all Animals were <i>ex ovo</i>; they began from hence to infer, that the
Rudiments of each Animal were originally in the respective Females, and
that the Male contributed only to give a new Ferment to the Mass of the
Blood and Spirits, by which means a spirituous Liquor (which the Blood
in its ordinary Ferment could not produce) did insinuate it self into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
the same Ducts and Pores of the Rudiments of those Animals, which were
in greatest forwardness in the Ovary, and so extend and enlarge all
their Parts, and at last bring them to perfection, as Mr.
<i>Perrault</i> does ingeniously discourse in the third Part of his
<i>Essais de Physique</i>; till now at last <i>Leowenhoek</i> has
discover'd an infinite number of <i>Animalcula in semine marium</i> of
all kinds, which has made him condemn the former Opinions about the
Propagation of all Animals <i>ex Ovo</i>.</p>

<p>Now upon comparing the Observations and Discoveries which have been
made with one another, these three things seem to me very probable.
1. That Animals are <i>ex Animalculo</i>. 2. That these Animalcles are
originally <i>in semine Marium</i> &amp; <i>non in Fœminis</i>. 3. That they
can never come forward, nor be formed into Animals of the respective
kind, without the <i>Ova in Fœminis</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these seems probable from these three Observations.
1. That some such thing has been so often observ'd by <i>Malpighius</i>,
in the <i>Cicatricula</i> of an Egg before Incubation, as the Rudiments
of an Animal in the shape of a Tadpole, as may be seen in his first, and
in his repeated Observations <i>de formatione Pulli in Ovo</i>. 2. The
sudden appearance and displaying of all the Parts after Incubation,
makes it probable, that they are not then actually formed out of a
fluid, but that the <i>Stamina</i> of them have been formerly there
existent, and are now expanded. The first Part of the Chick which is
discovered with the naked Eye, is, you know, the <i>Punctum saliens</i>,
and that not till three days and nights of Incubation be past; and then, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
the fifth day, the Rudiments of the Head and Body do appear. This made
Dr. <i>Harvey</i> conclude, that the Blood had a being before any other
Part of the Body; and that from it, all the Organs of the <i>Fœtus</i>
were both form'd and nourished: But by <i>Malpighius</i>'s Observations
we find that the Parts are then only so far extended, as to be made
visible to the naked Eye, and that they were actually existent before,
and discernable by Glasses. After an Incubation of thirty hours, are to
be seen the Head, the Eyes, and the <i>Carina</i> with the
<i>Vertebræ</i>, distinct, and the Heart. After forty hours its Pulse is
visible, and all the other Parts more distinct, which cannot be
discerned by the naked Eye before the beginning of the fifth day; from
whence it seems probable, that even the so early discovery of those
Parts of the <i>Fœtus</i> by the Microscope, is not the discerning of
Parts newly formed, but only more dilated and extended by receiving of
Nutriment from the <i>Colliquamentum</i>; so that they seem all to have
been actually existent before the Incubation of the Hen. And what
<i>Swammerdam</i> has discovered in the transformation of Insects, gives
no small light to this; whilst he makes appear in the Explanation of the
13th Table of the General History of Insects, that in those large
<i>Eruca's</i> which feed upon Cabbage, if they be taken about the time
they retire to be transformed into <i>Aurelia's</i>, and plung'd often
in warm Water to make a Rupture of the outer Skin, you will discern
through the transparency of their second Membrane, all the Parts of the
Butterfly, the Trunk, Wings, Feelers, <i>&amp;c.</i> folded up. But that
after the <i>Eruca</i> is chang'd into an <i>Aurelia</i>, none of these
Parts can be discern'd, they are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
drencht with moisture, tho' they be there actually form'd. Another
Consideration is from the Analogy, which we may suppose between Plants
and Animals. All Vegetables we do see proceed <i>ex Plantula</i>, the
Seeds of Vegetables being nothing else but little Plants of the same
kind folded up in Coats and Membranes; and from hence we may probably
conjecture, that so curiously an organized Creature as an Animal, is not
the sudden Product of a Fluid or <i>Colliquamentum</i>, but does much
rather proceed from an Animalcle of the same kind, and has all its
little Members folded up according to their several Joints and
Plicatures, which are afterwards enlarged and distended, as we see in
Plants. Now tho' this Consideration alone may seem not to bear much
weight; yet being join'd to the two former, they do mutually strengthen
each other. And indeed all the Laws of Motion, which are as yet
discovered, can give but a very lame account of the forming of a Plant
or Animal. We see how wretchedly <i>Des Cartes</i> came off when he
began to apply them to this Subject; they are formed by Laws yet unknown
to Mankind; and it seems most probable, that the <i>Stamina</i> of all
the Plants and Animals that have been, or ever shall be in the World,
have been form'd, <i>ab Origine Mundi</i>, by the Almighty Creator
within the first of each respective kind. And he who considers the
Nature of Vision, that it does not give us the true magnitude, but the
proportion of things; and that what seems to our naked Eye but a Point,
may truly be made up of as many Parts as seem to us to be in the whole
visible World, will not think this an absurd or impossible thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
But the second thing which later Discoveries have made probable, is,
that these Animalcles are originally <i>in Semine Marium</i> &amp; <i>non in
Fœminis</i>. And this I collect from these Considerations: 1. That there
are innumerable <i>Animalcula</i> discover'd <i>in Semine Masculo omnium
Animalium</i>. Mr. <i>Leewenhoeck</i> has made this so evident by so
many Observations, that I do not in the least question the truth of the
thing. The reason of their Multitude, and some of the Difficulties which
arise thereupon, he has cleared to very good Purpose, so that I shall
not repeat them. 2. The observing the Rudiments of the <i>Fœtus</i> in
Eggs, which have been fecundated by the Male, and the seeing no such
thing in those which are not fecundated, as appears from
<i>Malpighius</i> his Observations, make it very probable that these
Rudiments proceed originally from the Male, and not from the Female. 3.
The resemblance between the Rudiments of the <i>Fœtus in Ovo</i>, both
before and after Incubation, and the <i>Animalcle</i>, makes it very
probable, that they are one and the same. The same Shape and Figure
which Mr. <i>Leewenhoeck</i> gives us of the <i>Animalcle</i>,
<i>Malpighius</i> likewise gives of the Rudiments of the <i>Fœtus</i>,
both before and after Incubation; yea, and even the <i>Fœtus's</i> of
Animals do appear so at first to the naked Eye, so that Dr.
<i>Harvey</i> does acknowledge that all Animals, even the most perfect,
are begotten of a Worm, <i>De Gen. Anim. Ex.</i> 18. 4. This gives a
rational account of many <i>Fœtus's</i> at one Birth, especially that of
the Countess of <i>Holland</i>, and how at least a whole Cluster of Eggs
in a Hen are fecundated by one Coition of the Male. 5. This gives a new
light, as it were, to the first Prophecy concerning the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
<i>Messiah</i>, that the Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Head of the
Serpent, all the rest of Mankind being thus most properly and truly the
Seed of the Man. 6. The Analogy I have already mentioned, which we may
rationally suppose between the manner of the propagation of Plants and
Animals, does likewise make this probable. Every Herb and Tree bears its
Seed after its kind; which Seed is nothing else but a little Plant of
the same kind, which being thrown into the Earth, as into its
<i>Uterus</i>, spreads forth its Roots, and receives its Nourishment,
but has its form within its self, and we may rationally conjecture some
such Analogy in the Propagation of Animals.</p>

<p>The third Particular which later Discoveries make probable, is, that
Animals cannot be formed of these <i>Animalcula</i> without the <i>Ova
in fœminis</i>, which are necessary for supplying of them with proper
Nutriment: And this these Considerations seem to evince. 1. It is
probable that an <i>Animalcle</i> cannot come forward, if it do not fall
into a proper <i>Nidus</i>. This we see is the <i>Cicatricula</i> in
Eggs; and tho' a Million of them should fall into an Egg, none of them
would come forward, but what were in the Center of the
<i>Cicatricula</i>; and perhaps the <i>Nidus</i> necessary for their
formation is so proportion'd to their bulk, that it can hardly contain
more than one <i>Animalcle</i>; and this may be the reason why there are
so few Monsters. This we see is absolutely necessary in <i>Oviparis</i>;
and the only difference which seems to be between them and the
<i>Vivipara</i>, in this matter, is in this, that in the latter the
<i>Ova</i> are properly nothing more but the <i>Cicatricula</i>, with
its <i>Colliquamentum</i>, so that the <i>Fœtus</i> must spread forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
its Roots into the <i>Uterus</i> to receive its nourishment; but the
Eggs in <i>Oviparis</i> may be properly term'd an <i>Uterus</i>, in
relation to the <i>Fœtus</i>; for they contain not only the
<i>Cicatricula</i>, with its <i>Amnion</i> and the
<i>Colliquamentum</i>, which is the immediate nourishment of the
<i>Fœtus</i>, but also the materials which are to be converted into that
<i>Colliquamentum</i>; so that the <i>Fœtus</i> spreads forth its Roots
no farther than into the White and Yolk of the Egg, from whence it
derives all its nourishment. Now that an Animalcle cannot come forward
without some such proper <i>Nidus</i>, Mr. <i>Leewenhoeck</i> will not
readily deny; for if there were nothing needful, but their being thrown
into the <i>Uterus</i>, I do not see why many hundreds of them should
not come forward at once; for as to what Mr. <i>Leewenhoeck</i> says,
that one of them would be-dwarf and choak the rest; this might fall out
in process of time: But at first I do not see why many of them should
not grow together, whilst scatter'd in so large a Field (and yet no such
thing is observed) if there were not an absolute necessity of a
<i>Cicatricula</i> for their growth and thriving. Now, 2. That this
<i>Cicatricula</i> is not originally in <i>Utero</i>, seems evident from
the frequent Conceptions which have been found <i>extra Uterum</i>: Such
as the Child which continued Twenty six Years in the Woman of
<i>Tholouse</i>'s Belly, mention'd <i>Numb.</i> 139. of the <i>Philos.
Trans.</i> And the little <i>Fœtus</i> found in the <i>Abdomen de St.
Mere</i>, together with the Testicle torn and full of clotted Blood,
recorded <i>Numb.</i> 150. both taken out of the Journals <i>des
Savans</i>: Such also seem to be the <i>Fœtus</i> in the <i>Abdomen</i>
of the Woman of <i>Copenhagen</i>, mention'd in the <i>Nouvelles des
Lettres</i>, for <i>Sept.</i> 85. <i>pag.</i> 996. all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
the Members of which were easily to be felt through the Skin of the
Belly, and which she had carried in her Belly for four Years; and the
seven Years Gravidation, related by Dr. <i>Cole</i>, <i>Numb.</i> 172.
of the <i>Transact.</i> That these two were undoubtedly <i>extra
Uterum</i>, is uncertain, because the last was not open'd after her
death, and the former may be yet still alive. Now granting once the
necessity of a proper <i>Nidus</i>, for the formation of an Animalcle
into the Animal of its respective kind; these Observations make it
probable, that the <i>Testes</i> are the <i>Ovaria</i> appropriated for
this use; for tho' the Animalcles coming thither in such Cases may seem
to be extraordinary, and that usually the Impregnation is in
<i>Utero</i>; yet it may be collected from hence, that the
<i>Cicatriculæ</i> or <i>Ova</i> to be impregnated, are in <i>Testibus
fœmineis</i>; for if it were not so, the accidental coming of Animalcles
thither could not make them come forward more than in any other part of
the Body, since they cannot be formed and nourished without a proper
<i>Nidus</i>. But 3. It is acknowledg'd by all, that the <i>Fœtus in
Utero</i>, for some considerable time after Conception, has no connexion
with the Womb, that it sits wholly loose to it, and is perfectly a
little round Egg with the <i>Fœtus</i> in the midst, which sends forth
its Umbilical Vessels by degrees, and at last lays hold on the
<i>Uterus</i>. Now from hence it seems evident, that the
<i>Cicatricula</i>, which is the Fountain of the Animalcles nourishment,
does not sprout from the <i>Uterus</i>, but has its <i>Origin</i>
elsewhere, and falls in thither as into a fit Soil, from whence it may
draw Nutriment for the growth of the <i>Fœtus</i>, else it cannot be
easily imagin'd, how it should not have an immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
Connexion with the <i>Uterus</i> from the time of Conception. If you
join all these three Considerations together, <i>viz.</i> that an
<i>Animalcle</i> cannot come forward without a proper <i>Nidus</i> or
<i>Cicatricula</i>; that there have been frequent <i>Fœtus's extra
Uterum</i>; and that they have no <i>Adhæsion</i> to the <i>Uterus</i>,
for a considerable time after Conception, they seem to make it evident,
that Animals cannot be form'd <i>ex Animalculis</i> without the <i>Ova
in Fœminis</i>. To all these I shall subjoin the Proposal of an
<i>Experimentum Crucis</i>, which may seem to determine, whether the
<i>Testes Fœmineæ</i> be truly the <i>Ovaria</i>, <i>viz.</i> Open the
<i>Abdomen</i> of the Females of some kinds, and cut out these
Testicles, and this will determine, whether they be absolutely necessary
for the formation of Animals.</p>

<p>There are some Difficulties proposed against this Conjecture, which I
think may be easily resolved. Some object the distance between the
<i>Tubæ</i> or <i>Cornua Uteri</i>, and the Testicles; but to this is
opposed by <i>Swammerdam</i>, and others, the like distance between the
<i>Infundibulum</i>, in Hens and Frogs, and the Ovary; and yet it cannot
be denied that the Eggs are transmitted thro' this into the
<i>Uterus</i>: And besides <i>R. de Graef</i>, and others, have by
repeated Observations found that the <i>Cornua Uteri</i> do at certain
times after Conception, embrace the <i>Testes</i> on both sides the
<i>Uterus</i>. They object in the second place the great disproportion
between the pretended Eggs in the <i>Ovary</i>, and the Aperture of the
<i>Tubæ</i> or <i>Cornua Uteri</i>, the former being a great deal bigger
than the latter: But both <i>R. de Graef</i> and <i>Malpighius</i> have
clear'd that Matter, by making appear, that these Bladders in the Ovary
are not the <i>Ova</i>, but serve to form the <i>Glandules</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
within which the <i>Ova</i> are formed, which break through a small
<i>Papilla</i> opening in the <i>Glandule</i>, which bears a proportion
to the Aperture of the Tube. They object 3, The difficulty to conceive
how these Eggs should be impregnated <i>per semen Maris</i>, both
because there is no Connexion between the <i>Tubæ</i> and the
<i>Ovary</i> for its transmission, and for that Dr. <i>Harvey</i> could
never discover any thing of it <i>in Utero</i>. As to the last, Mr.
<i>Leewenhoeck</i> has cleared that difficulty, by the discovery of
innumerable <i>Animalcula Seminis Maris in Cornubus Uteri</i>, and those
living a considerable time after Coition. <i>Numb.</i> 174. of the
<i>Transact.</i> And as to the former, we may either suppose that there
is such an Inflation of the <i>Tubæ</i> or <i>Cornua Uteri tempore
Coitionis</i>, as makes them embrace the <i>Ovaria</i>, and such an
approach of the <i>Uterus</i> and its <i>Cornua</i>, as that I may
easily transmit the Seed into the <i>Ovary</i>; or else, that the
<i>Ova</i> are impregnated by the Animalcles after they descend into the
<i>Uterus</i>, and not in the <i>Ovary</i>; the former seems probable
for this Reason, that at least a whole Cluster of Eggs in a Hen will be
fecundated by one Tread of the Cock: Now this Fecundation seems to be in
the Vitellary, and not in the <i>Uterus</i>, as the Eggs pass along from
day to day; for it can hardly be supposed that the Animalcles should
subsist so long, being scattered loosely in the <i>Uterus</i>, as to
wait there for many days for the Fecundation of the Eggs as they pass
along. The latter Conjecture has this to strengthen it, that the
Animalcles are found to live a considerable time in the <i>Uterus</i>;
and that if they should impregnate the <i>Ova</i> in the Ovary it self,
the <i>Fœtus</i> would increase so fast, that the <i>Ova</i> could not
pass through the <i>Tubæ Uteri</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
but would either burst the Ovary, or fall down into the Abdomen from the
Orifices of the <i>Tubæ</i>; and that from hence proceed those
extraordinary Conceptions in <i>Abdomine extra Uterum</i>. But, 4. Mr.
<i>Leewehoeck</i>, <i>Numb.</i> 147. of the <i>Transact.</i> to weaken
the third Consideration about the Conceptions, being like unto an
<i>Ovum</i> in the Womb, proposes a Parallel between these Animalcles
and Insects; and insinuates, that as the latter cast their Skins, and
appear of another Shape, so the other which at first seem like Tadpoles,
may cast their outer Skin, and then be round; and that this may be the
occasion of the round Figure of the Conception in the Womb. To this it
may be replied, that according to Mr. <i>Leewenhoeck</i>'s own
Sentiment, the Animalcles cannot come forward, if they do not find the
<i>Punctum</i> or proper place for their Nourishment, to which it seems
they must have some <i>Adhæsion</i>. Now the Conception in
<i>Viviparis</i> is not fastned unto the Womb for many days, nor does
adhere to any point of it; so that it seems this roundish Body is not
the Animalcle thus chang'd after having cast an outer Skin, but is
rather the <i>Cicatricula</i> or little Egg, into which the Animalcle
has entred as its <i>Punctum</i> or place of nourishment; else I do not
see why they should not be adhering to the Womb from the first
Conception, or why (as I have said) many hundreds of them are not
conceiv'd and formed together, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3>A short Discourse concerning Concoction: Read at a Meeting of the
Royal Society, <strong>May ... 1699</strong>, by <strong>Clopton
Havers</strong>, M. D. Fellow of the Royal Society.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE manner in which the Digestion of the Aliment is
performed, is a thing not very easie to be understood and explained.
However, it has not escap'd the Conjectures of some Philosophical Men,
who having curiously observ'd the <i>Phænomena</i> of Nature, and
enquired into their Causes, have, amongst other things, endeavour'd to
account for this. But their Sentiments about it have been various, and
the Hypothesis, by which they have studied to explain it, very
different. Some have thought the Concoction of the Food to be a kind of
Elixation; and that the grosser and more solid Parts being, as it were,
boil'd in the Liquid by the Heat of the Stomach, and the Parts adjacent
to it, as the Liver, Spleen, and Omentum, are by a long and continued
Elixation, first render'd more tender, and then colliquated, and
dissolved into minuter Particles, so as to mix more equally with the
Fluid, and with that to make one Pulpament, or chylous Mass. And
<i>Hippocrates</i>, tho' he does not plainly call it an Elixation, yet
seems to attribute the Concoction of the Food to the Heat of the
Stomach, as the Cause of it, <i>Sect. 4. Libro de salubri victus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
ratione</i>. So where he takes notice of the voiding of such Fæces, as
appear to be like the Food that has been eaten; he adds, <i>Constat
enim, sane ventriculum, ciborum copiam, ut concoquat, calefacere non
posse</i>. And there are other Passages in the same Book, from which we
may conclude, that he suppos'd the Heat of the Stomach to be the great
Cause of the Digestion of the Food.</p>

<p>There are others that make the Stomach itself to be the great
Instrument of Digestion, but in a different manner: And they suppose it
to be perform'd by an Attrition, as if the Stomach, by those repeated
Motions, which are the necessary Effects of Respiration, when it is
distended by the Aliment, did both rub or grind off some minuter
Particles from the grosser Parts; and by continually agitating the Mass
of Food, make those Parts, which are not contiguous to the Stomach,
strike one against another, and break one another in pieces, until they
are all attenuated. It is evident enough, that the sides of the Stomach
do in Expiration press upon the <i>Contenta</i>, so as to oblige, at
least some Parts of them, every time the Muscles of the Abdomen are
contracted, to move and shift their places. So in Inspiration, when the
Diaphragm and Liver press upon the upper part of the Stomach, the
Aliment must be moved again. So that by these reciprocal Motions, that
part of the Food which is contiguous to the Stomach, and moves in a Line
parallel to it, must rub against it; and all the other Parts being moved
by such a Compression, as gives them a different Tendency, it is certain
they must be continually striking one against another. And for Bread,
and such things as are made of Flower,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
that will be softned and dissolv'd with any common Liquid, that
Agitation of the Stomach which moves them in Respiration, might seem
sufficient to break and dissolve them, when they are sufficiently
moisten'd with a Fluid. Yet this cannot be thought enough to break and
digest Flesh-meat, Fruits, or any other thing that will not be softned
and dissolv'd in Water, or some such Liquid. But although this Motion of
the Aliment, caused by Respiration, does not actually digest it, yet it
has a great and necessary Use in Concoction, and makes all the grosser
Parts, as they are attenuated, mix equally with the Fluid.</p>

<p>Some think that the Bilious Juice; others, that the Spirits are
chiefly concern'd in this Affair. <i>Galen</i>, in his Book <i>de
Neutralibus Facultatibus</i>, makes it to be the Effect, not of one, but
of several Causes; as a pituitous Juice in the Stomach, the Bile,
<i>&amp;c.</i> which appears from what he has said, and the Translator thus
render'd: '<i>Verum quanto ii (cibi) qui mansi sunt, iis, qui
inhæserunt, magis sunt alterati; tanto etiam his magis ii, qui devorati
sunt. Siquidem incomparabilis erit horum alterationis excessus, si &amp; quæ
in ventre est Pituita &amp; Bilis, &amp; Spiritus, &amp; Calor, &amp; tota Ventris
substantia, æstimentur.</i>'</p>

<p>Some there are that will have the Food to be dissolv'd by a
Menstruum, which is supply'd from the Glands of the Stomach, or some
other way: But those that do so far agree in the General, as to think
Concoction is perform'd by a Dissolvent, do differ in their Notions of
the Nature of the Menstruum: For there are some that suppose it to be an
Acid, which does erode the grosser parts of the Food, and dissolves them
in the same manner as Vinegar, Spirit of Vitriol,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
or any such-like Acid, will dissolve even so solid a Body as Iron. And
it cannot be deny'd, but that Oil of Vitriol will dissolve Flesh-meat,
and reduce it to a Pulp; but it is not to be suppos'd, that the Fibres
of the Stomach can admit any such strong and corroding Acid, without
something to correct it, but it must be injur'd in its Tone, and labour
under great and extraordinary Pains. Neither does such a Menstruum, tho'
it will digest some things, seem capable of dissolving so great a
Variety of Things as we eat, especially when a great many of them are of
a contrary Nature. Some will have the Menstruum to be a
<i>nitro-aerius</i> Spirit, that is, quick, and very penetrating, and
included in its proper Vehicle; which, being in its own Nature apt to
penetrate the Mass of the Aliment, does diffuse it self through the
Whole, and breaking the Vinculum of the more solid Parts, does dissolve
their Compages. By others, it is thought to be some saline Juice in the
Stomach, by which the Parts of the Aliment are divided and dissolved,
and those which are fit for Nourishment, are volatiliz'd.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, There are some others who reject the Opinions I have
already mention'd, and suppose the Digestion of the Food to be perform'd
by the Benefit of a Ferment; which, when it is mixed with the Aliment,
excites in the Mass an intestine motion; and the different and contrary
motions and tendency of the Parts, making some kind of Collision,
gradually break off Particles from the grosser, and more solid Parts,
till they are so attenuated as to be apt to mix more equally with the
Fluid, and with them to make one soft or chylous Substance. But yet
there is not amongst them an universal Consent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
either about the Nature of this Ferment, or the manner how it is
supply'd. For first, some think it to be the Remains of the Food that
was last digested; which having lain some time in the Stomach, after the
rest is carried down into the Intestines, contracts an Acid, or some
other Quality, and is so alter'd, as to partake of the Nature of a
Leaven. And this Leaven being a part of the Food, which has been already
digested, is so soft and liquid as to be capable of mixing with the
Aliment, which is next taken into the Stomach; and being agitated with
it by the repeated Pressures of the Diaphragm, Liver, and Abdominal
Muscles upon the Stomach in Respiration, does diffuse it self through
the whole Mass; and being mixed with it, like Leaven, or Yest added to
new Wort, <i>&amp;c.</i> puts it into a State of Fermentation; and by this
Fermentation, or the Expansion of the Ferment, and the more tenuious
Parts, which are first put into motion by it, those which are more
solid, and with which they are intermixed, are rent, and divided, and so
attenuated, as to become a soft and pulpous matter. And altho' the
greatest part of the Food, that is thus broken and concocted, is by the
Contraction of the Fibres of the Stomach press'd into the Duodenum; yet
they do not contract themselves so as to force out all the Aliment, but
leave between the <i>Rugæ</i> or Folds, on the inside of the Stomach, a
sufficient Quantity to be a Leaven to the next Meal; and so from time to
time.</p>

<p>Some have a Notion, That this Ferment, or Principle of Fermentation,
is in the Aliment it self; which being a Congeries of Matter, consisting
of various Parts of a different Nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
is no sooner enclosed in the Stomach, and digested in the Heat of that,
and the adjacent Parts, but the more spirituous and subtil Particles are
put into motion both from that Warmth, and the difference of their
Natures, and enter upon a Fermentation. And so by their intestine
Commotion, and the Violence they offer to those Parts which oppose the
tendency of any of them, they break and dissolve what is more solid.</p>

<p>Again: Some suppose, that this Ferment is supply'd from the Glands of
the Stomach.</p>

<p>And Lastly, Others, and perhaps with much better Reason, contend for
the Saliva, and make that to be the Ferment, which serves principally
for the Digestion of the Food; which in Mastication being mix'd with our
Aliment, is with that carried down into the Stomach, where the Parts of
it being put into motion by a kindly and agreeable Heat, they do ferment
with, and exagitate first those Parts of the Food which are most apt to
ferment with it, and then both conspire to break and dissolve the
grosser and more stubborn Parts. And <i>Galen</i>, in the Book I have
before-mention'd, plainly allows that the <i>Saliva</i> is concern'd in
the business of Concoction, tho' he supposes the Alteration, which is
produc'd by this Juice, to be made in the Mouth, as appears from these
Words: <i>Quæ (alteratio) in ore agitur mutat quidem id (nutrimentum) in
alteram speciem manifestè, non tamen ad perfectionem transmutat--Qui
mansi sunt cibi primum quidem hac Pituita (oris) imbuunter, &amp; cum ea
miscentur----Itaque majorem mutationem consecuti sunt, quam ii, qui in
vacuis dentium intervallis fuere impacti</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
Now I have given this short Account of the various Opinions of some
Ingenious Men, concerning the manner how Concoction is perform'd; I come
now to propose my own Hypothesis, by which I shall endeavour to explain
it.</p>

<p class="gap-above">In order to the more easie and effectual Digestion
of the Food, Nature has appointed some Parts for the breaking our
Aliment, and reducing whatever is gross into smaller Parts, before it is
put upon Digestion: Others to supply the Ferment, by which it is to be
dissolv'd and concocted, and which, before it comes to be included in
the Stomach, does moisten, and make it more soft, that it may more
easily be penetrated, and broken by those Parts which serve to divide
every Morsel into smaller Pieces, and prevents the Inconvenience and
Trouble which would arise from the Nourishment sticking about or between
them, when it is dry or viscous.</p>

<p>For the breaking of that part of our Food, which is not liquid,
Nature has furnish'd us with Teeth, and those of two sorts: For some are
ordain'd to divide and break off smaller Morsels from a larger Mass;
others are made for the grinding those Morsels into much smaller parts.
The Teeth, which serve to break off Pieces of a convenient Magnitude
from a larger Mass, are of two sorts, accommodated to the Nature of the
Substance which we eat. These are the <i>Incisores</i>, and the
<i>Dentes Canini</i>. If the Substance, which we have to eat, be not
hard, but more easily penetrated and divided, then the <i>Incisores</i>
are capable of making an Impression upon it, and fix'd firmly enough in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
Jaws to break off that part which they take hold of. But if it be more
solid, and not easily penetrated, nor any Piece without difficulty to be
separated from that Body, whereof it is a part; then we apply the
<i>Dentes Canini</i>, or Eye-Teeth, to it, which are not spread, nor
have such an edge as the <i>Incisores</i>, but are sharp and pointed
like an Awl, and so do more readily penetrate a Substance that is hard,
and which the <i>Incisores</i> can scarcely make any Impression upon.
And as the Parts of a more solid Body are commonly with more difficulty
separated, and there must be a greater stress put upon those Teeth which
pull it into pieces; so these Teeth are much more firmly fixed in the
Jaws than the <i>Incisores</i>, tho' they have but one single Root.
Besides, the Position of all these Teeth is accommodated to their use,
as being planted opposite to the Aperture of the Mouth; so that they may
be conveniently apply'd to the Substance which we have to eat, before it
is broken, and when it is too large to be admitted within the Mouth.</p>

<p>The Teeth which do by a Compression and Attrition reduce the little
Morsels to smaller Parts, are from the manner in which they break the
Aliment, called <i>Dentes Molares</i>, because they do, like so many
Mill-stones, grind the Food between them. And that they might be
render'd fit for this purpose, they are made broad at that Extremity,
which stands out of the Gums, by which means they retain some Quantity
of the Food between them every time the lower Jaw is pulled up and
forc'd against the <i>Maxilla superior</i>. And as they are broad, so
they are formed with Inequalities and Protuberances; and by the motion
of the lower Jaw,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
from one side towards the other, they grind what they have between them
into pieces. The Position of these Teeth too is as convenient as that of
the <i>Incisores</i>, and the <i>Dentes Canini</i>: For being design'd
to break those pieces of our solid Food, which are taken into the Mouth,
and these pieces, when they are compress'd, and mov'd by the <i>Dentes
Molares</i>, being apt to fly out of the Mouth, if there were no
Contrivance to prevent it, they are placed beyond the Aperture of the
Mouth, and opposite to the Cheeks, which keep the Food within that
Cavity, and not only so, but press it in between the <i>Dentes
Molares</i> on one side, as the Tongue does on the other, until they
have sufficiently broken and divided it.</p>

<p>At the same time, whilst the <i>Dentes Molares</i> are breaking the
Food, there flows into the Mouth a Salival Juice, which mixes with it,
and not only serves to moisten it, and to render it more apt and easie
to be divided, but seems to be the Ferment, by the Benefit of which the
Food is dissolved and digested. And therefore it is intimately mixed
with it, by the Teeth agitating or stirring them together in
Mastication.</p>

<p>This Liquor, which we commonly call the <i>Saliva</i>, or Spittle,
seems to be a Composition made of two several Juices, very different in
their Nature: And therefore the several Parts of it are separated by
their proper Glands, and Nature has planted no fewer than four Pair
about the Mouth, which supply the Juices that make the <i>Saliva</i>; to
wit, the <i>Parotides</i>, and the <i>Glandulæ Nuckianæ</i>, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
<i>Glandulæ Maxillares internæ</i>, and <i>Sublinguales</i>. Whereas if
the <i>Saliva</i> were but one more simple Liquor, a less number of
Glands might have been sufficient. At least there appears no Reason why
one of every Pair should disembogue itself into the Mouth so very near
to the Orifice, by which a Gland of some other Pair throws in its Juice;
and they are not rather all planted at more equal distances from one
another, so to flow in upon every part of the Aliment at the same
time.</p>

<p>Not that I suppose, as there are four Pair of salivatory Glands, so
there are four sorts of Juices supply'd from them, to make the
<i>Saliva</i>; but, as I hinted before, that there are only two
different Juices that constitute it. And these are not only sufficient,
but more proper to excite and secure that Fermentation, which is
necessary to Concoction. For we find that most of those Fermentations,
which arise upon Mixtures made for Experiments, are produced from the
mixture of two things; and it is not so easie to find out three or four
such Liquors of a different Nature, as will, upon the mixtion of them
all, produce a Fermentation, and from the omission of any one of them
discover no Discord or Disposition to ferment: Besides, it is certain
that two do better secure the End, which Nature designs. For, if there
were three or four different Juices, of which the <i>Saliva</i>
naturally consists, these must all have their proper Qualities preserved
to them, or else the Fermentation, which should arise between them, will
not necessarily follow upon their mixture; and it is certain, that there
would be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
Danger, that one of three or four should be deprived of its Natural
Quality, than one of two.</p>

<p>What Nature these two Juices are of, I do not pretend positively to
determine; but so far as I have been able to make my Conjectures about
it from Experiments, I do think one of them to be an acid Juice; the
other an oleaginous Liquor, something like Oil of Turpentine. For
amongst the many Experiments I have made, there was no one that gave me
so much Satisfaction, as that which I made with Oil of Turpentine, and
Oil of Vitriol, though I try'd several other things, that will produce a
Fermentation upon their Mixture. And it was for this Reason, that I made
the Experiment with Oil of Turpentine and the other Oil.</p>

<p>I took a piece of raw Flesh, and having cut it into pieces, but much
larger than what our more solid Food is reduc'd to by due Mastication, I
mix'd some Crums of Bread with it, then I pour'd in the Oil of
Turpentine to them, and upon that the Oil of Vitriol; and having shak'd
them together, I digested them about four Hours in <i>Balneo Mariæ</i>,
and then shaking them again in the Glass, I found the Meat dissolv'd,
and they all became a thickish Pulp. I could not but take notice, that
Oil of Camphire (though it does not otherwise seem much different in its
Nature from Oil of Turpentine) and Oil of Vitriol, which upon mixture
will produce an Effervescence as well as the Oil of Turpentine and Oil
of Vitriol, yet did not touch the Meat, upon which I poured them, so as
in the least to dissolve them. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
cannot deny but that an Acid, and a Solution of Salt of Tartar, did
dissolve some part of the Flesh-meat, which I mix'd them with, but yet
neither so soon, nor so perfectly as the two forementioned Oils. And I
do the rather think one of those Juices, which constitute the
<i>Saliva</i>, to be of the Nature of Oil of Turpentine, than of a fix'd
Salt, because it will correct and temper even Oil of Vitriol, so as to
render it more tolerable to the Fibres of the Stomach. Not that I
suppose the acid part of the <i>Saliva</i> to come near to the Acidity
of Oil of Vitriol. For though, when they are mix'd, they will make a
Liquor that may not be injurious to the Stomach; yet the acid Juice, if
it were so corrosive as Oil of Vitriol, would certainly be injurious and
painful to the Salivatory Ducts, which convey it to the Mouth before it
is mix'd with the oleaginous Liquor. But I only say it is an Acid, and
in some degree approaches to the Nature of that Oil. And Nature, which
can much better adapt several Causes for the Production of such an
Effect than Art, may attain her End by a more temperate Acid; though, at
the same time, we may be able to make some probable and true Conjectures
about the Nature of those Causes from Experiments.</p>

<p>It being most reasonable to suppose, that there are but two sorts of
Juices, of a different Quality, that make the <i>Saliva</i>, I do
conceive, that four of the eight Salivatory Glands, or two Pair of the
four, do supply one of these Juices, and the other four Glands the
other. And this seems to be a very good Reason, why they are so planted,
and the Orifice of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
Ducts so order'd, that the Juice, which is supply'd by one Gland, is
discharg'd into the Mouth, very near to the Orifice, by which the Juice
of a different Nature is transmitted from another, so that they must
necessarily meet and mix together. Thus the <i>Glandulæ Nuckianæ</i>,
and <i>Parotides</i>, throw in two different Juices by Orifices, which
open into the Mouth very near to one another; and the <i>Glandulæ
Maxillares internæ</i>, and <i>Sublinguales</i>, do below supply the
same kind of Juices by Orifices, that open so near to one another as to
secure the mixture of the two different Juices.</p>

<p>These Glands, I say, do between them afford two divers sorts of
Liquors, of such a Nature as are apt to ferment upon their first
Mixture, but perhaps more considerably when they come to be digested by
the Heat of the Stomach. So that the Colluctation, or Fermentation,
which attenuates and concocts the Food in the Stomach, does not
ordinarily arise between the Aliment and the <i>Saliva</i>, but between
the several Parts of the <i>Saliva</i> it self. And indeed, if the
<i>Saliva</i> did not consist of two Juices, whose Nature is in such a
manner different, as to render them apt to ferment upon their mixture,
it would be very hard to conceive how it should so readily and
indifferently serve for the Digestion of all Eatables; how it should
ferment with, and dissolve so great a variety of Things, not only of a
different, but of a contrary Nature; how it should ferment with Acids as
well as Alkalies, digest things that are cold, as well as hot or
temperate; some things that are salt, others that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
are insipid, bitter and sweet, mucilaginous, oily, <i>&amp;c.</i> But if we
suppose, that the Fermentation, which serves for the Digestion of the
Food, arises from a peculiar difference in the Nature of two Juices,
which constitute the <i>Saliva</i>, it will be easie to give a rational
Account of our Concoction of innumerable things of a different Nature.
And this seems to be as effectual, and a more certain way to attenuate
and dissolve the grosser Parts of our Food, than if the Fermentation
were made only between the <i>Saliva</i> and the Aliment: Besides, the
<i>Saliva</i> seems to discover a Fermentation upon the mixture of its
constituent Juices, even at those times when we do not actually eat; for
it is always attended with Bubbles, and a Froth, when it has not been at
all agitated in the Mouth, and many of those Bubbles will remain for
some considerable time after we have spit it out.</p>

<p>Nature therefore having appointed the <i>Saliva</i> for the digestion
of the Food, has taken care that it shall be thrown in upon the Aliment
on every side. Thus the <i>Glandulæ Nuckianæ</i>, and the
<i>Parotides</i>, supply their Juices to that part of the Food, which
lies on the outside of the Gums, between the Cheeks and the Teeth, and
the <i>Glandulæ Maxillares internæ</i>, and <i>Sublinguales</i>, do
bestow their Liquor upon the Meat, which is within the Teeth and Gums.
Neither has she had a Regard only to that Supply, which is due to all
the parts of our Food, but likewise to the mixture of the two different
Juices of the <i>Saliva</i>, which is necessary to its Fermentation. And
therefore, as I have already observ'd, the Orifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
of the Ducts, which belong to one sort of Glands, are placed near the
Aperture of a Duct, which conveys a Juice from one of the other Glands.
So the Ducts of the <i>Glandulæ Nuckianæ</i>, and the <i>Ductus
Stenoniani</i>, do on each side open into the Mouth, near one another;
and the salivatory Ducts of the <i>Glandulæ Sublinguales</i>, and the
<i>Maxillares internæ</i>, though they have distinct Orifices, empty
themselves under the same <i>Papillæ</i>, and the Juices, which are
supply'd by them, meet there, and flow into the Mouth together.</p>

<p>The several Parts of the <i>Saliva</i> being discharg'd into the
Mouth in such a manner as to meet and begin a Fermentation, the
<i>Saliva</i> does, partly as it is agitated, with the Food by the
Teeth, and some other parts of the Mouth; partly by its own Fluidity,
insinuate it self into, and mixes with the Food, and not only moistens
and softens it, but excites the Fermentation, which is to dissolve it.
And when the Aliment is thus mix'd with the <i>Saliva</i>, which serves
to ferment the whole Mass, it is then to be convey'd into the Stomach,
that great digestive Vessel of the Body, where the Fermentation is not
only continued, but improved.</p>

<p>The Nourishment being convey'd into the Cavity of the Stomach, is
there kept for some time in a digestive Heat, all which time it is under
a Fermentation, produc'd by the different Parts or Juices of the
<i>Saliva</i>, which are mix'd with it; which Fermentation does first
agitate the more tenuious or subtil parts of the Food, and puts them
into motion, and so with the Fermentation of its own, and those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
Alimentary Parts, which it first communicates a Motion to, improved by
the Heat of the Stomach, the <i>Saliva</i> must necessarily act upon the
grosser Parts. For the intestine Motion, which is excited in the Mass,
does not give the Particles, which are fermented, the same Tendency, but
what is so various and confus'd, that they must inevitably strike not
only one against another, but against those which are more gross, so as
to attenuate them, sometimes by a Collision, which strikes off smaller
Particles from the larger Parts; sometimes by a Compression, when the
Particles which are in Motion, happen to strike directly against any
grosser Part, on every side of it, sometimes by a kind of Explosion. For
without doubt the <i>Saliva</i>, which is fluid, insinuates it self into
the Interstices of the more crass Parts of the Aliment, and whatever is
agitated and expanded in those Interstices, requiring a larger space for
the Freedom of its Motion, and offering a Violence to every thing that
opposes its Tendency, will, like Gun-powder included in a Shell, force
its way out, and tear to pieces that Matter, which does endeavour to
confine it.</p>

<p>Thus the grosser Parts are broken and divided, until they are at last
so far attenuated as to mix more equally with the Fluid, and with them
to make one Pulp or Chylous Mass. And although I do not apprehend how
the Stomach should by its reciprocal Motions in Inspiration and
Expiration, be able to break and attenuate any Matter, that will not be
softned and dissolved by Agitation in a Liquid; yet it is certain that
these Motions, caused by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
the Diaphragm and Abdominal Muscles in Respiration, do make those Parts,
which are broken off, as they are dissolv'd, mix intimately with the
more Liquid; as the Meat which I digested with Oil of Turpentine, and
Oil of Vitriol, did by Agitation mix more equally with the Oils, and
became a Pulpament.</p>

<p>As the Juices, which constitute the <i>Saliva</i>, do ferment upon
their mixture, so it is probable, that from their Mixture and
Fermentation there results such a <i>Tertium quid</i>, as is apt to
ferment with the Bile. And therefore, when the Aliment has been under
the Fermentation, excited by the <i>Saliva</i>, a sufficient time, it is
then thrown into the <i>Duodenum</i>, where it meets with the bilious
Juice, which flows into that Intestine from the Liver, from which a new
Fermentation seems to begin; and the Commotion of the Parts of the
Aliment being still continued, does carry on the Business of Digestion
until the Food is perfectly concocted: Though it is probable, that this
new Fermentation serves not only for the more perfect Digestion of the
Food, but likewise for the Separation of the Chyle from the feculent
Parts.</p>

<p>Neither do I by a random Guess, and an ungrounded Conjecture, suppose
that from the Mixture and Fermentation of the two Juices, which
constitute the <i>Saliva</i>, there results a Matter, which is apt to
ferment with the Bile. But to me the Notion seem'd to be confirmed by an
Experiment that I made. For considering with my self, that the Bile is
generally allow'd to have much of a saponary Nature, I made a Solution
of Soap in fair Water, and mix'd it with the Oils of Turpentine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
and Vitriol first put together, and from their Mixture I observ'd a very
easie and gentle Fermentation, which continued for a considerable
time.</p>

<h3>A Discourse concerning some Influence of
<strong>Respiration</strong> on the <strong>Motion</strong> of the
<strong>Heart</strong>, hitherto unobserved. By <strong>J.
Drake</strong>, M. D. F. R. S.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THO' divers accurate Treatises of the <i>Heart</i>,
and its Action, have been written by Learned Men of several Nations,
especially by two of our own Country; the Great Dr. <i>Harvey</i>, to
whose happy Sagacity this Nation owes the Glory of the Invention of the
<i>Circulation</i> of the <i>Blood</i>; and the incomparable Dr.
<i>Lower</i>, to whom we are beholden for a compleat Display of the
<i>Mechanical Structure</i> of the <i>Heart</i>, and a most ingenious
Rationale of its Action. Yet there remain several Doubts and
Difficulties about it (in my Opinion) not sufficiently accounted for;
towards the resolving some of which, I shall offer what my own Thoughts
have suggested to me, and leave it to the Consideration of the
Reader.</p>

<p>The Learned Dr. <i>Lower</i> (whose accurate Piece on this Argument
will insure his Reputation so long as Physical Knowledge shall last in
esteem) has so well accounted for the <i>Systole</i>, or Contraction of
the Heart, from the <i>Mechanical</i> Structure of it, that he seems
almost to have exhausted the Subject; and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
he been as happy in discovering the true cause of the <i>Diastole</i>,
he had left little room for the Industry and Sagacity of others about
this <i>Viscus</i>.</p>

<p>But having judiciously and solidly explain'd the <i>Systole</i>, he
contents himself to ascribe the <i>Diastole</i> to a motion of
<i>Restitution</i>, which account gives me no Satisfaction: Because the
<i>Systole</i> being the proper, and (as himself confesses) the only
motion of the Heart, a State of <i>Contraction</i> seems to be the
natural State, and consequently without External Violence, it shou'd
have no <i>Diastole</i> at all.</p>

<p>This will appear more plain, if we consider the Circumstances of it,
and its Motion, as a Muscle, with respect to other Muscles. That
Contraction is the proper Action, and State of all Muscles, is evident
from Experience of Fact, as well as Reason. For, if any Muscle be freed
from the power of its <i>Antagonist</i>, it is immediately
<i>contracted</i>, and is not by any Action of the Will, or Spirits, to
be reduced to a State of <i>Dilatation</i>. Thus, if the <i>Musculi
Flexores</i> of any Joint be divided, the <i>Extensores</i> of that
Joint being by that means free'd from the contrary Action of their
<i>Antagonists</i>, that Joint is immediately extended without any
consent of the Will, and in that State it remains; and so <i>Vice
versa</i>, if the <i>Extensores</i> be divided. From whence it is plain,
that the Muscles have no restitutive Motion, but what they derive from
the Action of their <i>Antagonists</i>, by which they are balanc'd. Thus
likewise the <i>Sphincters</i> of the <i>Gula</i>, <i>Anus</i> and
<i>Vesica</i>, having no proper <i>Antagonists</i>, are always in a
State of Contraction, and suffer nothing to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
them, but what is forced through them by the contrary Action of some
stronger Muscles, which, though not properly to be call'd
<i>Antagonists</i>, yet on all necessary Occasions perform the Office of
such.</p>

<p>That the Heart is a Muscle, furnish'd and instructed for Motion like
other Muscles, is (in my Opinion at least) demonstrated beyond
Contradiction by Dr. <i>Lower</i> and others. And, as it is a
<i>Solitary</i> Muscle without any proper <i>Antagonist</i>, and not
directly under the power of the Will, nor exercising <i>Voluntary</i>
Motion, it approaches nearest to the <i>Sphincter</i> kind, which only
has these Conditions in common with it. But in constant and regular
Alternations of Contraction and Dilatation, it differs exceedingly from
all the Muscles of the Body.</p>

<p>This <i>reciprocal Æstus</i> of the Heart has given the Learned
abundance of trouble; who, finding nothing peculiar in the Structure,
which shou'd necessarily occasion it, nor any <i>Antagonist</i>, whose
re-action should produce it, have been extreamly perplex'd to find out
the cause of it.</p>

<p>But passing over the various Opinions of Authors, to avoid being
tedious, I shall take notice here only of the very Learned Dr.
<i>Lower</i>'s, in whose Account of the <i>Systole</i>, however solid
and ingenious, I observe something deficient, and whose
<i>Hypothesis</i> of the <i>Diastole</i> I think to be precarious and
false.</p>

<p>This Excellent Author, having by sound Arguments drawn from the
Structure and Mechanism of the Heart, establish'd the Certainty of its
<i>Muscular Motion</i>, rests satisfied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
without taking notice of any Assistance, that the Heart receives from
any other Part, except from the Brain, by the means of the eight pair of
Nerves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Part</i> 2<i>d</i>.<br />
<i>Prop.</i> 67.<br /><i>Prop.</i> 73.<br /><i>Prop.</i> 76.</div>
<p>The Accurate <i>Borellus</i>, in his <i>Oeconomia Animalis</i>,
computes the <i>Motive</i> Power of the <i>Machine</i> of the Heart to
be equal to, or to surmount that of a Weight of 3000<i>l.</i> The
<i>Obstacles</i> to the Motion of the Blood thro' the <i>Arteries</i> he
esteems equivalent to 180,000<i>l.</i> which is 60 times as much as he
rates the Force of the Heart at. Then deducting 45,000<i>l.</i> for the
adventitious Help of the <i>Muscular Elastic Coat</i> of the
<i>Arteries</i>, he leaves the Heart with a Force of 3,000<i>l.</i> to
overcome a resistance of 135,000<i>l.</i> that is, with 1, to remove
45.</p>

<p>This stupendous Effect he contents himself
to ascribe to the <i>Energy</i> of <i>Percussion</i>. But, had
he proceeded in his Calculation to the Veins,
which he allows to contain constantly a quantity
of Blood, quadruple to the Contents of the Arteries,
and to which this <i>Energy</i> of <i>Percussion</i> does
either not reach at all, or but very languidly,
he might probably have seen a necessity for some
other Expedient to remove so insuperable a Difficulty.</p>

<p>But not to insist rigorously on the Exactness
of this Calculation, (though the great Abilities
of the Author in this way, and his Ingenuity
and Modesty, are a sufficient Warrant for
the Accuracy of his Computations, and the
Fidelity of his Accounts) we may allow a much
greater Deduction, than would be justifiable,
without lessening the Difficulty. But this Account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
I have taken notice of purely for the sake
of the Calculation, which may be of use in the
Sequel; the account it self being in other respects
more defective than Dr. <i>Lower</i>'s, to which we
will return.</p>

<p>The Doctor, notwithstanding his great Sagacity,
appears (to me) to have overlook'd something
of very great moment, and importance in
the explication of the Action of the Heart.
For, tho' it should be granted, that the <i>Muscular
Fibres</i> of the Heart acted by the Nerves, are
the immediate Instruments of its <i>Constriction</i> or
<i>Systole</i>, yet it must not be denied, that the <i>Intercostal</i>
Muscles and <i>Diaphragm</i> are of great service
to aid and facilitate this Contraction, by
opening a Passage for the Blood through the
Lungs, which denied would be an invincible
Obstacle.</p>

<p>Neither do they promote it that way only.
The manner how they farther assist the Heart
in its Contraction, will appear manifestly, if we
consider the different Posture, Situation, and
Capacity of the Blood-Vessels of the Lungs in
the several times of <i>Elevation</i> and <i>Depression</i> of
the <i>Costæ</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Pulmonary</i> Artery rises from the <i>right</i>
Ventricle of the Heart, and runs in one Trunk,
till it comes to the <i>Aspera Arteria</i>, where it is
divided, and sends a Branch along with each
Division of the <i>Aspera Arteria</i>, according to
all the minutest Subdivisions, of which it is
likewise subdivided, accompanying all the
<i>Bronchi</i>, in their whole progress through the
Lungs.</p>

<p>The <i>Pulmonary</i> Vein, which empties itself
into the <i>Left</i> Ventricle of the Heart, spreads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
it self on the <i>Aspera Arteria</i> and <i>Bronchi</i>, in the
same manner that the Artery does.</p>

<p>The necessary confluence of this Disposition
if, that this Artery and Vein being co-extended
with, and fasten'd to the <i>Bronchi</i>, must needs
suffer such alteration of <i>Superficial</i> Dimensions,
as the <i>Bronchi</i> do in the <i>Elevation</i> or <i>Depression</i> of
the <i>Costæ</i>.</p>

<p>While the Ribs are in a State of <i>Depression</i>
(whether before Commerce with the External
Air or after) the <i>Annular Cartilages</i> of the <i>Bronchi</i>
shrink one into another, and by that means
their <i>Dimensions</i> are exceedingly contracted. In
conformity to this condition of the <i>Bronchi</i>, the
<i>Pulmonary</i> Artery and Vein must likewise, either
by means of their <i>Muscular</i> Coats, contract
themselves to the same <i>Dimensions</i>, or lye
in <i>Folds</i> or <i>Corrugations</i>, which is less probable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the Ribs are elevated,
and the <i>Diaphragm</i> bears downward, the
Air rushing into the Lungs, shoots out the <i>Cartilaginous</i>
Rings, and <i>divaricates</i> the Branches of
the <i>Trachea</i>, and by them extends and divaricates
the several Divisions of the <i>Pulmonary</i> Artery and
Veins, and thereby lengthens and enlarges their
Cavities.</p>

<p>This enlargement of their Cavities is very
considerable, not only upon the score of the
addition, which they receive in length thereby,
but also upon the account of their <i>Divarication</i>.
For whereas, when the Ribs are depress'd,
and the Lungs subside, the Blood-vessels
are not only contracted, (as I have already
observ'd) but their Branches, which are
exceeding numerous, approach one another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
and lie in <i>juxta-position</i>, by which their Cavities
are very much compress'd and streighten'd: When
the Ribs are elevated, and the Lungs turgid with
Air, not only the Fibres, by which their Coats
in the opposite state were contracted, are extended;
but those innumerable Vessels, which lying
before in lines almost parallel upon one
another, compress'd one another, making an
<i>acute</i> Angle at their Junctures, are divaricated
and separated from each other, and make an
<i>obtuse</i>, whereby their Channels are widened.</p>

<p>Thus a passage is open'd to the Blood, from
the <i>Right</i> Ventricle of the Heart to the <i>Left</i>,
through the Lungs, to which it could not otherwise
pass; and the opposition, which the
Blood contain'd in that Ventricle, must otherwise
necessarily have made to its Constriction,
is taken off, and the <i>Systole</i> thereby facilitated.</p>

<p>Nor is that all. For the <i>Diastole</i> being
caus'd (as I shall in the Sequel shew) by the
force of the Blood rushing into the Ventricles,
this Ampliation and Extension of the <i>Pulmonary</i>
Artery is a sort of <i>Check</i> or <i>Counterpoise</i>
to it, and prevents an endeavour towards two
contrary Actions at once, which must necessarily
frustrate both. For the Heart being a
<i>Springy</i>, <i>Compressible</i> Body, whose proper Action,
which is Contraction, depends on the influx of
certain Fluids into its Fibers, or Substance;
and containing besides a Fluid in its <i>Ventricles</i>,
or great Cavities, in one of which is the
Mouth of this Artery, the action of this Vessel
must in great measure resemble that of a
<i>Syringe</i>, whose extremity is immers'd in Water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
the Enlargement or Expansion of the Chanels
of the Artery answering the drawing of the
<i>Embolum</i>, as the constrictive motion of the Muscle
of the Heart does the pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i>
upon the <i>Surface</i> of the Water, the one
making way for the fluid, and the other forcing
it to follow, where the resistance is least. In this
Sense we may allow a sort of Attraction to the
<i>Pulmonary</i>-Artery, depending wholly upon the
Action of the <i>Intercostal</i> Muscles and <i>Diaphragm</i>,
which we must therefore confess to be very serviceable
and instrumental in promoting the <i>Systole</i>
of the Heart.</p>

<p>But if the Learned Author be deficient in his
Account of the <i>Systole</i>; that is, if he has not
observ'd all the Mechanism and Contrivance of
Nature for the Contraction of the Heart; much
less sufficiently has he accounted for the <i>Diastole</i>,
or Dilatation of it, which he ascribes to a
motion of <i>Restitution</i> of the over-strain'd Fibres,
which yet he confesses are made for <i>Constriction</i>
only. 'Tis true, he immediately after joins the
<i>Influx</i> of the <i>Blood</i> as a concurrent Cause; but
from the slight notice that he takes of it, 'tis
plain, that he did not so much as dream of any
great share it had in that Action. His Words
are these:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>De Corde,<br />Pag. 75.</i></div>
<p><i>Quin &amp; (ut obiter hoc moneam) omnis motus contractione
perficiatur, &amp; Cordis Fibræ ad constrictionem solum factæ sint, apparet
quoque Cordis motum <strong>totum</strong> in <strong>Systole</strong>
positum esse; cumque Fibræ ultra tonum suum in omni constrictione eius
tendantur, idcirco ubi nixus iste absolvitur, motu quasi
<strong>restitutionis</strong> Cor iterum relaxatur, &amp; sanguine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
à Venis <strong>influente</strong> rursus distenditur; à
<strong>nullo</strong> enim cordis motu, nisi <strong>tensionem suam
remittente</strong>, &amp; ab <strong>irruente</strong> sanguine
<strong>Diastole</strong> ejus libratis adeo viribus succedit.</i></p>

<p>I have transcrib'd the intire Paragraph, because it contains his
whole <i>Hypothesis</i> of the <i>Diastole</i>, and all the notice that
he takes of it through his whole Work. But how slender soever this may
prove, it is the most substantial that I have any where met with, except
a late one of Mr. <i>Cowper</i>, which is properly an Improvement of
this, and shall be consider'd in the Sequel.</p>

<p>But if Contraction be the sole Action of these Fibres (as this Great
Man confesses it to be) and as indeed it is of all <i>Muscular</i>
Fibres, I wonder how so judicious a Writer came to slip into such an
Absurdity, as to call their Distention (vulgarly but improperly call'd
Relaxation) a Motion of <i>Restitution</i>. For from the Nature of those
Fibres, and their disposition in the Structure of the Heart, the natural
State of the Heart appears manifestly to be <i>Tonical</i>, and its
Dilatation a State of Violence; and consequently, the Constriction is
the <i>true</i> motion of <i>Restitution</i>, and the State to which it
will <i>spontaneously</i> return, when the Force is taken off, which is
the work of the <i>Intercostal</i> Muscles and <i>Diaphragm</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we are left still to seek for the true Cause of the
<i>Diastole</i>, which seems to me to be the main and most difficult
<i>Phænomenon</i>, relating to the Heart and the Circulation of the
Blood. But in Mr. <i>Cowper</i>'s ingenious <i>Introduction</i> to his
<i>Anatomy of Humane Bodies</i>, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
find the Share which Dr. <i>Lower</i> hints the Blood to have in that
Action, further prosecuted, and improved into the main Instrument of the
Dilatation of the Heart, wherein I agree intirely with him. But as to
the manner, and reasons of its being so very instrumental, I can't be so
perfectly of his mind.</p>

<p><i>The Heart (<strong>says this accurate Anatomist</strong>) of an
Animal bears a great Analogy to the Pendulums of those Artificial
Automata, Clocks and Watches, whilst its motion is performed like that
of other Muscles, the Blood doing the Office of a
<strong>Pondus</strong>.</i></p>

<p>This Explication, being but a Simile without a distinct application
to Particulars, is beside so very short, that I can at best but give a
conjecture at the meaning; which if I mistake, I shall deserve to be
excused, and expect to be better inform'd.</p>

<p>By the <i>Bloods</i> doing the Office of a <i>Pondus</i>, I suppose
he means, that the Blood contributes in the same manner to the motion of
the Heart, as the <i>Weights</i> do to that of the <i>Pendulum</i> of a
<i>Clock</i>. If so, the Blood, according to him, must be the Instrument
of <i>Constriction</i>; and <i>Dilatation</i> must be the <i>Natural</i>
State, or <i>Spontaneous</i> Motion, to which it wou'd, when under no
violence, return; the contrary of which, I presume, will appear e're I
have done.</p>

<p>But if he means, that the <i>Blood</i> in its reflux, by
<i>gravitating</i> on the <i>Auricles</i> and <i>Ventricles</i>, dilates
and expands 'em, acting therein as a <i>Counterpoise</i> to its
contractions as a Muscle, I cou'd wish his Design had not bound him up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
to so narrow a compass, and that he had given us an explication at large
of so abstruse and so important a <i>Phænomenon</i>: Because the
<i>Specifick Gravity</i> of the Blood seems to me a cause by no means
alone adequate to the effect, which it is here suppos'd to produce.</p>

<p>For, if the Blood acts only as a <i>weight</i> by meer
<i>gravitation</i>, then that part of it only which descends from the
Parts above the Heart can be employ'd in that Action. This at the
largest computation can't amount to Five pound weight, and must,
according to the computation of <i>Borellus</i>, force a Machine, that
is able to overcome a resistance of 135,000<i>l.</i> I leave every Man
to deduct what he shall upon examination find reasonably to be deducted,
and yet shall rest secure, that it is not to be effected in the least
with so small a Weight.</p>

<p>But neither does the <i>Refluent</i> Blood gravitate in any such
proportion, as I have here assign'd. For to make a true estimate of its
<i>Gravitation</i>, we must consider the Circumstances of the Liquor
suppos'd to gravitate; in which it very much resembles Water inclos'd in
a recurve Tube, of which, if the length of the two Legs be equal, it may
be suspended in the Air full of Water, with the Extremities downwards,
without losing a drop, although the <i>Diameter</i> of those Legs should
be very unequal. The Case of the Arteries and Veins is pretty near a
parallel to a Tube, so fill'd and inverted. For, if the Arteries and
Veins be continued Tubes, (as by the Microscope they are made to appear)
then supposing their contents to have no other determination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
of motion, than their own weight wou'd give them, the contain'd Fluids
must be Counterpoises to each other. For the Veins and Arteries being
join'd at the smaller Extremities, and the larger of both terminating in
the same parallel Line, it is impossible, according to the Laws of
<i>Hydrostaticks</i>, that the contents of either shou'd overbalance
t'other. How far then must it fall short of forcing the natural Power
and Resistance of so strong a Muscle as the Heart, by meer
Gravitation?</p>

<p>The Blood indeed has a <i>Progressive</i> Motion through its Vessels,
wherein it differs from Water, in a recurve Tube, in the Experiment
above-stated. But, if the natural Gravitation of the Blood contributes
nothing to the Dilatation of the Heart, this progressive Motion will not
be found much more sufficient. For, as this Motion is deriv'd intirely
from the Heart's Constriction (as all Accounts hitherto derive it) cou'd
the Blood be suppos'd to re-act upon it by the Heart, with all the force
first impress'd upon it by the Heart, it would be insufficient, unless
we will suppose the <i>Force communicated</i> to be superiour to the
<i>Power Communicant</i>, which is absurd.</p>

<p>But when the just and necessary Deductions for the Impediments, which
the Blood meets with in its Progress through the Vessels, shall be made,
the remaining Force will be found so exceeding weak, that to prop the
Blood through the Veins may be a task alone too great for so small a
Power, without charging it with the additional difficulty of forcing the
Muscle of the Heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
<i>Alphonsus Borellus</i>, after a great deal of solemn pains taken to
shew his Care and Exactness, and to possess his Reader of the Truth of
his Calculations, casts up the force of the Heart, and the
<i>Muscular</i> Coat of the Arteries, to be together equal to a weight
of 3,750<i>l.</i> and allots them a Resistance equal to 180,000<i>l.</i>
to overcome which is 45 to 1. To make up for a disproportion, by his own
confession, incredible to those who have not consider'd the Matter as he
had done, he flings into the Scale the additional <i>Force of
Percussion</i>, which he leaves <i>indefinite</i>, and thinks sufficient
to <i>force any quiescent finite Resistance whatsoever</i>.</p>

<p>But as this Account and <i>Hypothesis</i> are part of a Posthumous
Work (if a liberty of Conjecture may be allow'd in so uncertain a
Matter,) I shou'd suspect, that these Papers were left unfinish'd by
<i>Borellus</i>; or at least, that in many places the last Hand was
never put to them. For neither in this Place, nor any other of this
Work, does he account for any more than the <i>Systole</i> of the Heart,
and the resistance which is made to the progressive motion of the Blood
in the Arteries only. This alone he found to exceed the Power of the
Heart so prodigiously, that he seems to shuffle it off his Hands with a
general and precarious Solution, as a difficulty that he was desirous to
be rid of. For, having ascrib'd this <i>stupendous</i> (as he himself
calls it) effect to the <i>Energy of Percussion</i>, he takes no care to
satisfie his Reader any farther about it, or to refer him, or give him
the expectation of Satisfaction any where else; although he has an
express Treatise on the <i>Force of Percussion</i>, which was written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
preparatory to this, and to which he frequently refers in other Places
of this Work. But what confirms my suspicion, that this part was
intended for a farther Revise by the Author, is, that he has left the
Progress of the Blood through the Veins, and the <i>Diastole</i> of the
Heart, absolutely untouch'd, tho' they are Difficulties of a much
greater magnitude than this, which he has attempted to account so
slightly for: For, in these he is excluded the benefit of
<i>Percussion</i>, and has yet a greater resistance to overcome without
it. Omissions of this kind are so unusual with this Author, where-ever
he knows himself to go upon sure grounds, that it is to me an Argument,
that he doubted the sufficience of his <i>Percussion</i>, and reserv'd
these important <i>Phænomena</i> for farther Consideration, without
plunging himself into such an Absurdity, as to ascribe to
<i>Percussion</i> any such <i>Energy</i> as to be able (so broken as it
returns to the Heart) by its re-action to force that Power, from whence
only it was at first deriv'd.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Lower</i>, and Mr. <i>Cowper</i>, deliver their Opinions of
the Cause of the Dilatation of the Heart so very short, and without any
Arguments to support them, that by exposing them naked, they seem rather
to discourse of it transiently, as Men oblig'd by the Nature of their
Subjects to say something of it, than solicitous to give any full or
satisfactory Account; and therefore I shall proceed no farther upon them
here.</p>

<p>But though the <i>Hypothesis</i> of <i>Borellus</i> may, in this
Case, be found precarious or insufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
(a Misfortune that has befallen him in divers other Particulars) his
<i>Theory</i> holds still good. At least it ought to be allow'd, in
justice to his great Abilities and Exactness, till some Body convicts
him of some material Error in his Calculations, which has not as yet
been done by any Body, that I know of.</p>

<p>Supposing then the force of the Heart, and of the <i>Muscular</i>
Coat of the Arteries, as likewise of the resistance, which they must
overcome, to be computed with any degree of accuracy, there remains yet
such a prodigious disproportion to be accounted for, as requires some
more powerful Agent, than any yet assign'd, to make up the
deficiency.</p>

<p>What assistance the Heart receives from the action of the
<i>Thorax</i> towards the facilitating its Contraction, without which
assistance there cou'd have been no <i>Systole</i>, has been already
shewn. But neither the <i>Intercostal</i> Muscles, or <i>Diaphragm</i>,
which are so instrumental in that part of its action, can contribute any
thing to the <i>Diastole</i>; because they serve only to enlarge the
Cavity of the <i>Thorax</i>, and thereby to open a passage to the Blood
from the Heart, and promote its Constriction.</p>

<p>Whatever therefore the force is, that dilates the Heart, and is the
cause of the <i>Diastole</i>, it must be equal to that of the Heart, the
<i>Intercostal</i> Muscles and <i>Diaphragm</i>; to all which it acts as
an Antagonist. I take no notice of the <i>Serratus Major Anticus</i>,
and other Muscles; which have an obscure share in the <i>Elevation</i>
of the <i>Costæ</i>, because as much may reasonably be deducted upon the
account of the <i>Obliquus externus Abdominis</i>, and other Muscles;
which having their Insertions on some of the lower <i>Ribs</i> are as
instrumental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
towards the <i>Depression</i> of them, and so balance the Account. But
the chief use of these is in violent Respiration: In ordinary
Respiration their share is small.</p>

<p>Such a real Power (which may in the least be suspected of any share
in this Action) is hard, perhaps impossible to be found in the
<i>Machine</i> of any <i>Animal</i> Body; and yet without some such
Antagonist, it is as impossible the Circulation of the Blood should be
maintain'd. All the Engines yet discover'd within the Body, conspire
towards the <i>Constriction</i> of the Heart, which is the <i>State</i>
of <i>Quiescence</i>, to which it naturally tends. Yet we find it
alternately in a <i>State</i> of <i>Violence</i>, that is, of
<i>Dilatation</i>; and this upon necessity, because upon this
<i>Alternation</i> depends all Animal Life.</p>

<p>Some sufficient Cause External must therefore be found, to produce
this great <i>Phænomenon</i>; which Cause must be either in the
<i>Air</i>, or <i>Atmosphere</i>, because we have no constant and
immediate Commerce with any other <i>Mediums</i>.</p>

<p>Some great Physicians observing this, and that depriv'd by whatsoever
means of Communication with the <i>external</i> Air, we became instantly
extinct, have imagin'd, that in the Act of Inspiration certain purer
parts of the Air, mixed with the Blood in the Lungs, and was convey'd
with it to the Heart, where it nourish'd a sort of <i>Vital Flame</i>,
which was the Cause of this reciprocal <i>Æstus</i> of the Heart. Others
not quite so gross, rejecting an <i>Actual Flame</i>, have fancied, that
these fine Parts of Air mixing with the Blood in the Ventricles of the
Heart, produc'd an <i>Effervescence</i> which dilated it. But these
Fancies have been long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
since exploded and condemn'd upon ample Conviction; and 'tis a Point yet
undetermin'd, whether any Air does mix with the Blood at all in the
Lungs, or not.</p>

<p>But supposing, that some Air may insinuate it self into the
<i>Pulmonary</i> Vein, it can no other way dilate the Heart than by an
Effervescence in the Left Ventricle, which wou'd not dilate the Right.
But this Opinion is contradicted by <i>Autopsie</i>, and too laboriously
confuted by others, to be brought upon the Stage again here.</p>

<p>There remains therefore only the <i>gross Body</i> of the
<i>Atmosphere</i> to be considered, which is undoubtedly the <i>true
Antagonist</i> to all those Muscles, which serve for ordinary
Inspiration, and the Constriction of the Heart. This will appear more
evidently, if we consider not only the Power, but the Necessity of its
Action upon <i>Animal</i> Bodies, as well as the want of other
sufficient Agents.</p>

<p>The Heart is a <i>Solitary</i> Muscle of very great strength, and the
<i>Intercostal</i> Muscles and Diaphragm, which likewise have no
<i>Antagonists</i>, are a vast additional Force, which must be balanc'd
by the contrary Action of some equivalent Power or other. For, tho' the
Action of the <i>Intercostal</i> Muscles be voluntary, that does not
exempt them from the condition of all other Muscles serving for
<i>voluntary</i> motion, which wou'd be in a State of perpetual
Contraction, notwithstanding any Influence of the Will, were it not for
the Libration of <i>Antagonist</i> Muscles. This Libration between other
Muscles, is answer'd by the <i>Weight</i> of the incumbent
<i>Atmosphere</i>, which presses upon the <i>Thorax</i> and other parts
of the Body. And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
as in all other voluntary Motions the influence of the Will only gives a
prevalence to one of its two Powers before equilibrated, so here it
serves to enable those Muscles to lift up a weight too ponderous for
their strength not so assisted; and therefore as soon as that assistance
is withdrawn, the <i>Costæ</i> are again depress'd by the meer
<i>Gravitation</i> of the <i>Atmosphere</i>, which wou'd otherwise
remain elevated through the natural Tendency of those Muscles to
Contraction.</p>

<p>This is evidently prov'd from the <i>Torricellian</i> Experiments,
and those made upon Animals in Mr. <i>Boyle</i>'s Engine; where, as soon
as the Air is withdrawn, and the <i>pressure</i> thereby taken off, the
Intercostal Muscles and Diaphragm are contracted, and the Ribs elevated
in an instant, and can't by any Power of the Will be made to subside,
till the Air is again let in to bear them forcibly down.</p>

<p>It were scarce worth while to take notice here of a Mistake of the
Learned Dr. <i>Willis</i>, were it not for the great Authority of the
Man, which is almost sufficient to keep Error in countenance.
<span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span><i>De Respirationis<br />Organis &amp; Usu.</i>
<span class="hidev">|</span></span>
The Doctor having observ'd, that the Fibres of the <i>External</i> and
<i>Internal Intercostal</i> Muscles ran in a contrary order, as it were,
decussating each other, takes occasion from thence to fansie, that there
was an opposition in their Office; and that as the <i>External</i>
serv'd to raise up the Ribs, the <i>Internal</i> drew them down again,
forgetting at that time, That, when a contractile Body is fasten'd at
the several ends to Points unequally moveable, let the Contraction
happen in what part or manner soever, the more moveable Point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
must be drawn towards the less moveable: By which Rule, whether
<i>External</i> or <i>Internal Intercostals</i> be contracted, the lower
Ribs will be forc'd to approach the upper, that is, be rais'd up.</p>

<p>As in the Elevation of the <i>Costæ</i>, the Blood, by the passage
that is open'd for it, is in a manner solicited into the Lungs; so in
the Depression of them, by the subsidence of the Lungs, and the
Contraction of the Blood-Vessels, both which are consequent thereof, the
Blood is forcibly driven, as it were with an <i>Embolum</i>, through the
Pulmonary Vein into the Left Ventricle of the Heart. And this, together
with the <i>general Compression</i> of the <i>Body</i> by the
<i>weight</i> of the <i>Atmosphere</i>, which surrounds and presses upon
the whole Surface of it, is that Power which causes the Blood to mount
in the Veins, after the force impress'd upon it by the Heart is broken
and spent, and which is sufficient to force the Heart from its natural
State to Dilatation.</p>

<p>He that is able to compute the weight of a Column of Air, equal to
the Surface of the whole Body, will readily grant it a power sufficient
for the Effects, which are here ascrib'd to it. And when he considers,
that the Bodies of Animals are compressible Machines, he will find that
it must of necessity affect them in the manner here laid down. But
though our Bodies be entirely compos'd of <i>Tubuli</i>, or Vessels
fill'd with Fluids; yet this pressure, how great soever, being equal,
cou'd have no effect upon them, if the superficial Dimensions were not
easily variable; because being compress'd on all parts with the same
degree of Force, the contain'd Fluids cou'd not any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
where begin to recede, and make way for the rest to follow, but wou'd
remain as fix'd and immoveable as if they were actually solid. But by
the Dilatation of the <i>Thorax</i>, room is made for the Fluids to
move, and by the Coarctation of it, fresh motion is imprest, which is
the main Spring whereby the Circulation is set and kept going.</p>

<p>This reciprocal Dilatation and Contraction of the superficial
Dimensions of the Body, seems so necessary to Animal Life, that there is
not any Animal so imperfect as to want it, at least none to the inward
Structure, of which our Anatomical Discoveries have yet reach'd. For,
tho' most kinds of <i>Fish</i> and <i>Insects</i>, want both
<i>moveable</i> Ribs and Lungs, and consequently have no dilatable
<i>Thorax</i>, yet that want is made up to 'em by an <i>Analogous</i>
Mechanism, answering sufficiently the Necessities of their Life.</p>

<p>Those Fishes which have no Lungs, have <i>Gills</i>, which do the
<i>Office</i> of Lungs, receiving and expelling alternately the Water,
whereby the <i>Blood-Vessels</i> suffer the same alteration of
Dimensions, that they do in the Lungs of more perfect Animals.</p>

<p>The Lungs or <i>Air-Vessels</i> of Insects, are yet exceedingly more
different in Structure, Distribution, and Situation from those of
perfect Animals, than those of Fishes are, and yet in their Use and
Action agree perfectly with both; that is, <i>receiving</i> and
<i>expelling</i> the Air, and <i>varying</i> the <i>Dimensions</i> and
<i>Capacities</i> of the <i>Blood-Vessels</i>. These having no
<i>Thorax</i>, or separate Cavity for the Heart and Air-Vessels, have
the latter distributed through the whole Trunk of their Bodies, by which
they communicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
with the <i>External</i> Air through several <i>Spiracula</i> or
<i>Vent-holes</i>, to which are fasten'd so many little <i>Tracheæ</i>,
or Wind-pipes, which thence send their Branches to all the Muscles and
<i>Viscera</i>, and seem to accompany the Blood-Vessels all over the
Body, as they do in the Lungs only of perfect Animals. By this
disposition in every <i>Inspiration</i>, the whole Body of these little
Animals is inflated, and in every <i>Expiration</i> compress'd; and
consequently the Blood-Vessels must suffer a <i>Vicissitude</i> of
Extension and Contraction, and a greater motion must thereby be
impress'd upon the Fluids contain'd in them, than the Heart, which does
not in those Creatures appear to be Muscular, seems capable of
giving.</p>

<p>The only Animal that is exempted from this necessary condition of
<i>Breathing</i>, or <i>receiving</i> and <i>expelling alternately some
Fluid</i> into and out of the Body, is a <i>Fœtus</i>. But this, while
included in the Womb, has little more than a <i>vegetative</i> Life, and
ought scarce to be reckon'd among the number of <i>Animals</i>. For,
were it not for that small share of <i>Muscular</i> Motion, which it
exercises in the Womb, it might without absurdity be accounted for as a
Graft upon, or Branch of the Mother.</p>

<p>Concerning the immediate Matter, and Means of Life, and Nutrition,
Authors are not agreed, nor is it the business of this place to
reconcile, or decide their Differences, but to account for the Motion of
the Blood through the Vessels only. In order to this, it will be
necessary to observe, that the Pulsation of the Heart in a <i>Fœtus</i>
is so very weak and obscure, and the Motion of the Blood so extream slow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
and languid, as to be scarce, if at all perceivable, as has been
experienced in the Dissection of Puppies before Respiration had. To
<span class="sni"><span
class="hidev">|</span>Boyle <i>of the Elasticity of Air. Pechlinus de
Aeris &amp; Alimenti defectu.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
produce such a feeble Palpitation, and creeping Motion, no greater force
seems to be required, than may be deriv'd from the Communication between
the Vessels of the Mother and <i>Fœtus</i> in the <i>Placenta</i>. I am
not ignorant, that divers very Learned Anatomists (whom the Crowd have
implicitly follow'd) have absolutely rejected all Communication between
these Vessels. But, with submission to Great Authorities, I think they
have acted arbitrarily, and without sufficient Warrant from Reason or
Experiment: For neither are the Arguments which they bring against it
conclusive, nor the Office which they assign to the Umbilical Vessels in
lieu of it, proper, or natural to those Vessels, or the reality of the
Fact made out by any substantial Reasons. Those that reject this
Communication usually do it in favour of one or both of these Opinions,
that the Arteries of the <i>Uterus</i> do deposite a Nutritive Juice, or
a Juice impregnate <i>with Air</i> in the <i>Placenta</i>, which is
suck'd in by the <i>Umbilical</i> Vein, and convey'd to the
<i>Fœtus</i>, for the necessary Uses of Nutrition and Life. Now those
that patronize either of these Opinions, lead Nature an unnecessary
Dance. For if the <i>Maternal</i> Blood does really contain any such
<i>Nutritious</i>, or any such necessary <i>Aerial Particles</i>, why
shou'd they be separated and extravasated, to be with difficulty
receiv'd into the <i>Umbilical</i> Vein, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
again mixt with the Blood, when they might more easily have been
imparted by the plain simple way of Transfusion from the Arteries of the
<i>Mother</i> to the Veins of the <i>Fœtus</i>. And, that this is the
course which Nature takes in this Case, I am perswaded from the easiness
and simplicity of the Method, which readily performs what might be
perhaps in vain expected from the other, and wou'd over and above find
them, what they seem to grope so blindly about for, a first Mover of the
Blood in a <i>Fœtus</i>.</p>

<p>Those that contend for the conveyance of the <i>Nutricious</i> Juice,
through the <i>Umbilical</i> Vein from the <i>Placenta</i>, are forc'd
upon two Difficulties next to Absurdities. For first they are oblig'd to
make this Vein, which, as all other Veins, seems dedicated to the
Re-conveyance of Blood only, the proper and immediate Chanel, thro'
which a very different Liquour is to be carried; and next, to give a
Power of Attraction or Suction to it; because the <i>Nutricious</i>
Juice, which it is thus destin'd to carry, is both viscous and stagnant,
and has neither force to drive, nor subtilty to penetrate, or insinuate
it self into the Capillary Veins; and therefore must be drawn or suck'd
as <i>Milk</i> is from the <i>Breast</i>, to which the <i>Placenta</i>
and its <i>Nutricious</i> Juice are by the Favourers of them expresly
compar'd. But if this were the sole use of the <i>Placenta</i>, and
<i>Umbilical Vessels</i>, why were the Umbilical <i>Arteries</i> sent
along with the Vein? Their business is not to bring any thing back to
the <i>Fœtus</i>, nor can they contribute any thing to the benefit of
the <i>Mother</i>; for the <i>Uterine</i> Arteries bring all to the
<i>Placenta</i>, the Umbilical Vein carries it to the <i>Fœtus</i>, and
the <i>Uterine</i> Veins convey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
back again the Surcharge of the <i>Mother</i>'s Blood; the Umbilical
<i>Arteries</i> only, have nothing to do, and are superfluous and
impertinent, which is contrary to the constant Practice of Nature. Yet
if <i>Autopsie</i> did in the least countenance this Hypothesis, some
Defence might still be made; but we find in the Umbilical <i>Vein</i> of
a <i>Fœtus</i> nothing but <i>Florid</i> Blood, such as in all
probability it received immediately from the <i>Arteries</i> of the
<i>Mother</i> without any mixture. And therefore I can't help
concluding, that this Opinion engages its Favourers in some Absurdity,
without Necessity and without Proof.</p>

<p>They that from the <i>Placenta</i> supply the Body of the
<i>Fœtus</i> with <i>Air</i>, are as much distress'd as t'other; for
they are forc'd to beg the Question twice, which, even when granted,
will not answer their Ends. First, they suppose, that an intimate
mixture or confusion of <i>Air</i> with the <i>Blood</i>, is necessary
for the support of Animal Life, a <i>Postulatum</i>, which perhaps the
former part of this Discourse may have render'd unnecessary; and next,
that the <i>Fœtus</i> is supply'd with <i>Air</i> from, and its
<i>Blood</i> mix'd with it in the <i>Placenta</i>.</p>

<p>But here again they fetch a Compass without necessity or proof. For
if a mixture of <i>Air</i> were necessary to a <i>Fœtus</i>, why should
it be separated from the <i>Mother</i>'s Blood, and not rather both
communicated together, since it is so much more easie and commodious?
But neither does the <i>Placenta</i> seem to be instructed and provided
for the separation of <i>Air</i>, but of a much <i>grosser Fluid</i>,
destin'd to some other use, which <i>Autopsie</i> confirms: Yet, were
both these Opinions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
true, they are however defective, and the Circular Motion of the Blood
unprovided for.</p>

<p>By the way of <i>Transfusion</i>, this great Phænomenon is naturally
accounted for, and the Ends, for which the other two Hypotheses were
devis'd, might both be answer'd with more ease. For the <i>Hysterick</i>
Arteries transmitting their Blood immediately to the <i>Umbilical</i>
Vein, may very easily transmit such <i>Nutricious</i> Juices or
<i>Aerìal</i> Particles, as are contain'd in the Blood, along with it,
without depositing them by the way. By this means so much of the Impulse
of the Mother's Blood is preserv'd, as suffices to maintain that languid
Circulation which a <i>Fœtus</i> enjoys. For the Blood being driven
through the <i>Arteries</i> of the <i>Uterus</i> into the <i>Umbilical
Vein</i>, is convey'd directly to the <i>Sinus</i> of the <i>Porta</i>,
and thence by a short and direct Passage through the <i>Cava</i> to the
Heart; where passing through the <i>Foramen Ovale</i> to the <i>Left</i>
Ventricle, and through the <i>Canalis Arteriosus</i> from the
<i>Right</i> and <i>Pulmonary</i> Artery, it is all deliver'd without
coming at the <i>Lungs</i> to the <i>Aorta</i>, and from thence again by
the <i>Umbilical Arteries</i> to the <i>Veins</i> of the <i>Uterus</i>,
making a sort of <i>Epicycle</i> to the main Circulation in the
Mother.</p>

<p>As this Opinion is Favour'd by the Structure and Disposition of the
Blood-Vessels on both Parts, so there is nothing in it difficult to be
conceiv'd, or repugnant to Experience. Late Discoveries have made it
appear, that the Arteries and Veins are continu'd Tubes, and that the
latter contain nothing but what they receive from the former, and no
Reason appears why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
we shou'd think this Method to be varied in the <i>Placenta</i>. On the
other hand, if the Arteries of the <i>Uterus</i> were continued to the
Veins of the <i>same</i> part, and those of the <i>Fœtus</i> in like
manner, without communicating with each other, their Confluence in the
<i>Placenta</i> seems to be altogether impertinent, and of no use, and
the <i>Umbilical</i> Arteries and Vein fram'd for no other Service or
Purpose, than to give the Blood room for an idle Sally.</p>

<p>Thus the Reasonableness of this old Opinion may be vindicated, but
the Certainty of it rests upon stronger Proof. Mr. <i>Cowper</i>, to
whose happy Industry we owe the Confirmation of many ancient
Discoveries, and the Benefit of some new ones, has the Honour to
re-establish this old, but long exploded Truth. For by pouring
<i>Mercury</i> into a Branch of the <i>Uterine Arterie</i> of a
<i>Cow</i>, that went into one of the <i>Cotyledones</i> of the
<i>Uterus</i>, he fill'd those Branches of the <i>Umbilical</i> Veins,
which went from that <i>Cotyledon</i> to the <i>Navel</i> of the
<i>Fœtus</i>; which, with a part of the <i>Uterus</i>, he keeps prepared
by him.</p>

<p>It would be a weak Objection, to alledge, That the Observation and
Experiment being made on the <i>Uterus</i> of a <i>Cow</i>, the
Inference would not hold from thence to a <i>Woman</i>, the one being
<i>Glanduliferous</i>, and the other <i>Placentiferous</i>; since every
one of these <i>Cotyledones</i>, or <i>Uterine Glandules</i>, is in all
respects a little <i>Placenta</i>, and all the difference between them
is in number, name, and magnitude. Why <i>Ruminants</i> differ in this
Particular from other <i>Viviparous</i> Animals, is beside the Subject
of our present Enquiry. But the great Flux of Blood, which constantly
follows upon drawing the <i>Placenta</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
from Women (which is frequently so great as to cost them their Lives) is
as plain a demonstration to Reason of the <i>Continuity</i> of the
Vessels, as Mr. <i>Cowper</i>'s Experiments is to the Eye.</p>

<p>I have heard it objected by very Learned Men, that if there were such
a <i>Continuity</i> of Vessels, and such <i>Transfusion</i> of Blood,
the <i>Fœtus</i> must necessarily perish through loss of Blood, upon the
separation of the <i>Placenta</i> from the <i>Uterus</i>; but that, on
the contrary, no visible Flux of Blood does follow while the
<i>Fœtus</i> continues wrapt in the Membrane, in which Condition it may
be kept alive some Hours. To this it may be answer'd, that the
Circulation in the <i>Fœtus</i>, being deriv'd from the Mother, may be
suppos'd wholly to cease upon the cutting off the Communication between
them, till it is again renew'd more forcibly by <i>Respiration</i>. But
if we allow the motion already impress'd upon the Blood to be sufficient
to keep it going a little while; yet it must needs be so exceeding
languid, that the meer resistance of the External Air must be more than
enough to hinder any Efflux of Blood from a <i>Fœtus</i> before
Respiration. How long Life may be preserv'd without an <i>actual</i>
Circulation of the Blood, is a Question not of this place. But we have
been convinc'd by many and notorious Observations and Experiments, that
Life has been recover'd a long time after all tokens of Respiration,
Circulation, or even Life it self, have disappear'd; so that we can't
think the first Solution either impossible or improbable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">{198}</a></span> I expect to be told, that in the early
Days of <i>Gestation</i> in <i>Viviparous</i> Animals, there is no
<i>Placenta</i>, or any Adhesion of the <i>Umbilical</i> Vessels to any
part of the <i>Mother</i>, and consequently no such <i>Transfusion</i>;
and that in <i>Oviparous</i> there is no <i>continuity</i>, or
<i>communication</i> of Vessels of any kind, during the whole time of
<i>Incubation</i>.</p>

<p>But these Objections carry neither the Weight nor Difficulty along
with them, that they may be suppos'd to do; for in those Days there is
neither <i>Blood</i> or <i>Blood-Vessels</i>, and consequently there can
be no <i>Circulation</i> of the <i>Blood</i>; and the <i>Embryo</i>, of
what Species soever, is no more than a <i>Vegetable</i> at that time;
nor does the <i>Fœtus</i> of any <i>Viviparous</i> Creature enjoy any
<i>Circulation</i>, or shew any signs of Animal Life, till after those
Vessels, as well as others requisite to the Circulation, are
compleated.</p>

<p>It must be confess'd, that <i>Oviparous</i> Animals are denied the
benefit of this Communication; but that want is sufficiently compensated
by a peculiar Mechanism, which directly answers the ends of
<i>Respiration</i>, and the <i>pressure</i> of the <i>Atmosphere</i>
upon the <i>Fœtus</i>. There is at the <i>obtuse</i> end of an Egg a
small Cavity fill'd with Air, which is the succedaneous Instrument to
the <i>Respiratory</i> Organs. For as soon as the Contents begin to be
warm'd by the <i>Incubation</i> of the Hen, or <i>any analogous</i> Heat
of <i>Furnace</i> or <i>Dunghill</i>, the several Humours of the Egg
require a <i>fermentative</i> motion, and the <i>Air</i> contain'd in
the <i>Cavity</i> or <i>Vesicle</i>, at the <i>obtuse</i> end of the
Egg, is rarefied, and the Vesicle extended and enlarg'd, and
consequently the other Contents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
are comprest; to which the <i>fermentative</i> motion naturally resists.
But both Bodies being as well <i>compressible</i> as <i>dilatable</i>,
and both having an <i>expansive</i> motion imprest upon them by
<i>Incubation</i>, the Compression and Renitency will be mutual, but
varied in degree, according as either, through the variation of
Circumstances, shall prevail. By this means, an Alternation of
Compression and Dilatation will be produc'd in both, answering the
<i>respiratory</i> motion, by which a motion will be communicated,
which, as soon as the Organs by which it should be regulated are
compleated, will in the Body of the <i>Pullus</i> be <i>regular</i> and
<i>circulatory</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fabricius</i> ab <i>Aquapendente</i>, and after him, our Great Dr.
<i>Harvey</i>, have assign'd divers Uses to this Cavity or Air Vesicle,
the Extravagance of which have perhaps deterr'd others from enquiring so
much into the Use, as the Importance of it requir'd. But though I can't
agree to that <i>Perspiration</i>, <i>Refrigeration</i>, and
<i>Respiration</i>, which they make it the Instrument of; yet perhaps
the <i>Air</i>, that was inclos'd in that <i>Cavity</i>, may through the
Augmentation of the Body of the <i>Pullus</i>, and its own
<i>Rarefaction</i> (which is at last so great as to occupy half the
Shell) break the <i>Membrane</i>, which separated it from the
<i>Pullus</i>, and thereby give so much <i>Respiration</i> as to form
the <i>chirping Voice</i>, which is often heard before the breaking of
the Shell, and with it give an addition of Strength to enable it to
break the Shell. But how it should respire sooner, is to me
inconceivable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
There are many Problems of great seeming Difficulty, the Solutions of
which flow naturally from what has been laid down here: But intending to
prosecute this Subject farther, and to treat of the Impediments of
Respiration, and the Consequences of Respiration obstructed or
intermitted, I shall reserve them for that Opportunity, and content my
self here to attempt the <i>Harveyan</i> Problem only, which has given
abundance of Authors so much perplexity.</p>

<p>That incomparable Philosopher enquires, <i>Why a
<strong>Fœtus</strong>, taken out of the <strong>Uterus</strong> with
the <strong>Membranes</strong> intire, shall live in Water some Hours
without communication with the <strong>External Air</strong>; whereas if
it be taken out and suffer'd once to breath, it can't afterwards survive
a Moment without the benefit of <strong>Respiration</strong>.</i></p>

<p>Granting the Fact to be as he has deliver'd it, which yet is not so
in all Cases, the main Difficulty is grounded on a Mistake, which from
the stating of the Question I find this Great Man to have slipt into.
For he thinks, that a <i>Fœtus</i> is sooner suffocated after having
once breath'd, than if it had not breath'd at all, and that by breathing
it had contracted something which render'd it more perishable. <i>Idem
tamen secundis exutus, (<strong>says he</strong>) si semel
<strong>aerem</strong> intra <strong>Pulmones</strong> attraxerit,
postea ne momentum quidem temporis absque eo durare possit, sed
confestim moriatur.</i> And presently after, <i>Siquidem constat, fœtum,
postquam <strong>eum semel</strong> hauserit, <strong>citius</strong>
suffocari; quam cum ab <strong>illo prorsus</strong> accebatur.</i> The
Doctor observing a <i>Fœtus</i> to live longer without Respiration, and
to dispence better with the want of Air while included in the Membranes
intire, than it cou'd afterwards; infers thence, that the Air does in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
the first Act of Inspiration impress upon the Lungs some quality, which
renders it ever after more indispensably necessary. But allowing his
Observation, I must yet deny his Inference to be good: For deprive a
<i>Fœtus</i> of means of respiring, and then take it out of the
Membranes, and it shall be as soon suffocated, as if it had respired
before. This proves, that this necessity of intercourse with the Air, by
way of the Lungs, is not the Offspring, but the Parent of Respiration,
and that, that Learned Man was drawn into a Fallacy of <i>Non causa pro
causa</i>.</p>

<p>The Reason of this Necessity is the pressure of the External Air upon
the Surface of the Body, from which it was defended by the Interposition
of the Membranes, and the Humours contain'd, which are not so
compressible as the Body of the <i>Fœtus</i> it self. So soon therefore
as the <i>Fœtus</i> is excluded, and expos'd to the immediate contact of
the ambient Atmosphere, the Vessels and all the Cavities of the Body
must necessarily be so compress'd, that the Fluids can't have room for
motion, and consequently the <i>Fœtus</i> could have no Life, if Nature
had not contriv'd by the motion of the <i>Thorax</i> to remove and admit
that pressure alternately, and thereby to impress a motion on the
Fluids, which is the Spring of Life. But this motion of the
<i>Thorax</i> being any way suppress'd, the equal pressure of the
Atmosphere on all parts, occasions a total Cessation of motion, which is
Death.</p>

<p>I shall prosecute this Subject no farther now, nor trouble the Reader
with any Apology, for dissenting from those Great Men herein named;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
because, I hope, I have done it with Modesty, and all the Respect due to
so great Authorities, and have assign'd nothing which is not Matter of
Fact uncontroverted, or deduc'd from it by plain Mechanical
Necessity.</p>

<h3>Some Thoughts and Experiments concerning
<strong>Vegetation</strong>. By <strong>John Woodward</strong>, M. D. of
the College of Physicians, and R. S. and Professor of Physick in
<strong>Gresham College</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE <i>Ancients</i> generally intitled the
<i>Earth</i> to the Production of the <i>Animals</i>, <i>Vegetables</i>,
and <i>other Bodies</i> upon and about it; and that for that Reason
'twas, that they gave it so frequently the Epithets of <i>Parent</i> and
<i>Mother</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>.
They were of opinion, that it furnished forth the <i>Matter</i> whereof
<i>those Bodies</i> consist; and receiv'd it all back again at their
Dissolution for the Composure of <i>others</i>. Even those who asserted
<i>four Elements</i>, supposed that the <i>Earth</i> was the
<i>Matter</i> that <i>constituted</i> those Bodies; and that
<i>Water</i> and the <i>rest</i>, serv'd only for the <i>Conveyance</i>
and <i>Distribution</i> of that <i>Matter</i>, in order to the
<i>forming</i> and <i>composition</i> of them. 'Tis true, <i>Thales</i>,
a Philosopher of the first Rank in those early Ages, has been thought to
have Sentiments very different from these; but that without just
Grounds, as I think I have sufficiently prov'd in another Paper, which I
am ready to produce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
But though <i>Antiquity</i> thus gave its <i>Vote</i> for <i>Terrestrial
Matter</i>, several of the <i>Moderns</i>, and some of very <i>great
Name</i> too, both <i>here</i> and <i>abroad</i>, have gone quite
counter, and given <i>theirs</i> in behalf of <i>Water</i>. The
<i>Dignity</i> of the <i>Persons</i> that have espoused it, as well as
their <i>Numbers</i>, renders this Doctrine very considerable, and well
worth our enquiring into. The great Restorer of <i>Philosophy</i> in
this last Age, my Lord <i>Bacon</i>, is of Opinion, <i>That for
Nourishment of <strong>Vegetables</strong>, the Water is almost all in
all; and that the Earth doth but keep the Plant upright, and save it
from over-heat, and over-cold</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>.
Others there are who are still more express; and assert Water to be the
only Principle or Ingredient of all Natural Things. They suppose that, I
cannot tell by what Process of Nature, Water is <i>transmuted</i> into
<i>Stones</i>, into <i>Plants</i>, and in brief, all other Substances
whatever. <i>Helmont</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
particularly, and his <i>Followers</i>, are very positive in this; and
offer some <i>Experiments</i> to render it credible. Nay, a very
<i>Extraordinary Person</i> of our own <i>Nation</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
tries those <i>Experiments</i> over again; and discovers a great
Propensity to the same Thoughts and Opinion they had; declaring for this
<i>Transmutation of Water</i> into <i>Plants</i> and <i>other
Bodies</i>, though with great Modesty and Deference, which was his usual
manner.</p>

<p>The <i>Experiments</i> they insist upon are chiefly <i>two</i>; the
<i>first</i> is, that <i>Mint</i>, and several <i>other</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
<i>Plants</i> prosper and thrive very greatly in <i>Water</i>. The
<i>other</i> is this; they take a certain quantity of <i>Earth</i>, and
<i>bake</i> it in an <i>Oven</i>; then they weigh it, and put it into an
<i>Earthen Pot</i>. Having well water'd this <i>Earth</i>, they make
choice of some fit <i>Plant</i>, which, being first carefully
<i>weigh'd</i>, they <i>set</i> in it. There they let it grow,
continuing to <i>water it</i> for some time, till 'tis much advanced in
<i>bigness</i>: Then they take it up; and though the <i>Bulk</i> and
<i>Weight</i> of the <i>Plant</i> be much greater than when <i>first
set</i>, yet upon <i>baking</i> the <i>Earth</i>, and <i>weighing</i>
it, as at first, they find it little or not at all diminished in
<i>weight</i>; and therefore conclude, 'tis not the <i>Earth</i> but
<i>Water</i>, that nourishes and is <i>turn'd</i> into the Substance of
the <i>Plant</i>.</p>

<p>I must confess I cannot see how <i>this Experiment</i> can ever be
made with the <i>nicety</i> and <i>justness</i> that is requisite, in
order to <i>build</i> upon it so <i>much</i> as <i>these Gentlemen</i>
do. 'Tis hard to weigh <i>Earth</i> in that <i>quantity</i>, or
<i>Plants</i> of the <i>size</i> of those they mention, with any great
<i>exactness</i>; or to <i>bake</i> the Earth with that <i>accuracy</i>,
as to reduce it <i>twice</i> to just the <i>same Driness</i>. But I may
wave all this; for though the <i>Experiment</i> be never so easily
practicable, and all the Accidents of it exactly as they set forth, yet
nothing like what they <i>infer</i> can possibly be concluded from it;
unless <i>Water</i>, which they so plentifully bestow upon the
<i>Plant</i> in <i>this Experiment</i>, be <i>pure</i>,
<i>homogeneous</i>, and not charged with any <i>terrestrial Mixture</i>;
for if it be, the Plant after all may owe its <i>Growth</i> and
<i>Encrease</i> intirely to <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
Some <i>Waters</i> are indeed so very <i>clear</i> and
<i>transparent</i>, that one would not easily suspect any <i>terrestrial
Matter</i> were latent in them; but they may be <i>highly saturated</i>
with such <i>Matter</i>, though the Eye be not presently able to descry
or discern it. 'Tis true, <i>Earth</i> is an <i>Opake Body</i>; but it
may be so far dissolved, reduced to so extreme small Particles, and
these so <i>diffused</i> through the <i>watry Mass</i>, as not sensibly
to impede <i>Vision</i>, or render the Water much the less
<i>diaphanous</i>. <i>Silver</i> is an <i>Opake</i>, and indeed a very
<i>dense Body</i>; and yet, if perfectly <i>dissolved</i> in
<i>Spirit</i> of <i>Nitre</i>, or <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, that is
<i>rectified</i> and thorowly <i>fine</i>, it does not <i>darken</i> the
<i>Menstruum</i>, or render it less <i>pellucid</i> than before<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>.
And other Instances there are, that oftentimes <i>great quantities</i>
of <i>Opake Matter</i> are sustain'd in <i>Fluids</i>, without
considerably striking the <i>Eye</i>, or being perceiv'd by it. So that
were there <i>Water</i> any where found so <i>pure</i>, that the
quickest Eye could discover in it no <i>terrestrial Intermixture</i>;
that would be far short of a <i>Proof</i>, that in reality there was
<i>none</i>.</p>

<p>But after all, even the <i>clearest Water</i> is very far from being
<i>pure</i> and wholly <i>defecate</i>, in any part of the World that I
can learn. For ours here, I have had an Opportunity of examining it over
a good part of <i>England</i>; and cannot say I ever met with any, that,
however fresh and newly taken out of the Spring, did not exhibit, even
to the naked Eye, great numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
of exceeding small terrestrial Particles disseminated through all parts
of it. Thicker and crasser Water exhibits them in still greater
Plenty.</p>

<p>These are of two general kinds. The one a vegetable terrestrial
Matter, consisting of very different Corpuscles; some whereof are proper
for the formation and increment of one sort of Plant, and some of
another; as also some for the Nourishment of one part of the same Plant,
and some of another. The other kind of Particles sustain'd in Water are
of a Mineral Nature. These likewise are of different sorts. In some
Springs we find common Salt, in others <i>Vitriol</i>, in others
<i>Alum</i>, <i>Nitre</i>, <i>Sparr</i>, <i>Ochre</i>, &amp;c. nay,
frequently several of these, or other Minerals, all in the same Spring;
the Water as it drains and passes thorough the <i>Strata</i> of Stone,
Earth, and the like, taking up and bearing along such loose Mineral
Corpuscles, as it meets with in the Pores and Interstices of those
<i>Strata</i>, and bringing them on with it quite to the Spring. All
Water whatever is much charg'd with the Vegetable Matter, this being
fine, light, and easily moveable. For the Mineral, the Water of Springs
contains more of it than that of Rivers, especially when at distance
from their Sources; and that of Rivers more than the Water that falls in
Rain. This I have learn'd from several Trials, which I must not give
Account of here; my Drift in this place being only to evince the
Existence of Terrestrial Matter in Water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
Any one who desires farther Satisfaction in this, may easily obtain it,
if he only put Water into a clear Glass Viol, stopping it close, to keep
Dust and other exterior Matter out, and letting it stand, without
stirring it for some Days: He will then find a considerable Quantity of
terrestrial Matter in the Water, however pure and free it might appear
when first put into the Viol. He will in a very short time observe, as I
have frequently done, the Corpuscles that were at first, while the Water
was agitated and kept in motion, separate, and hardly visible<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>,
by degrees, as the Water permits, by its becoming more still and at
rest, assembling and combining together; by that means forming somewhat
larger and more conspicuous <i>Moleculæ</i>. Afterwards he may behold
these joining and fixing each to other, by that means forming large thin
Masses, appearing like <i>Nubeculæ</i>, or Clouds in the Water; which
grow more thick and opake, by the continual appulse and accretion of
fresh Matter. If the said Matter be chiefly of the Vegetable kind, it
will be sustain'd in the Water; and discover at length a green Colour,
becoming still more and more of that Colour, I mean an higher and more
saturate Green, as the Matter thickens and encreases. That this
<i>Matter</i> inclines so much to that <i>Colour</i>, is the less
strange, since we see so large a share of it, when constituting
Vegetables wearing the same Colour in them. But if there be any
considerable quantity of meer Mineral Matter in the Water, this, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
of a greater specifick Gravity than the Vegetable, as the Particles of
it unite and combine in such Number, till they form a <i>Molecula</i>,
the Impetus of whose Gravity surpasses that of the Resistance of the
Water, subsides a great deal of it to the <i>bottom</i>. Nor does it
only fall down it self, but frequently entangling with the <i>Vegetable
Nubeculæ</i>, forces them down along with it.</p>

<p>The Reason why Bodies, when dissolved and reduced to extreme small
Parts, are sustain'd in Liquors that are of less specifick Gravity than
those Bodies are, hath been pointed at by a late ingenious Member of
this Society<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>.
He is indeed far from having adjusted all the <i>Momenta</i> of this
Affair; however it must be admitted, that, in the <i>dividing</i> or
<i>solution</i> of Bodies, their Surfaces do not decrease in the same
Proportion that their Bulk does. Now the Gravity of a Body, which is the
Cause of its sinking or tendency downwards, is commensurate to its Bulk;
but the resistance that the Liquor makes, is proportion'd, not to the
Bulk, but to the Extent of the Surface of the Body immersed in it.
Whence 'tis plain, a Body may be so far divided, that its Parts may be
sustain'd in a Fluid, whose specifick Gravity is less than that of the
said Body. Nay, 'tis Matter of Fact, that they frequently are so; and we
daily see <i>Menstrua</i> supporting the Parts of <i>Metals</i>, and
other Bodies, that are of six, ten, nay, almost twenty times the
specifick Gravity of those <i>Menstrua</i>. And as the Parts of Bodies
when divided, are thus supported in a Fluid; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
when they occur and unite again, they must sink of course, and fall to
the Bottom.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, 'tis palpable and beyond reasonable Contest, that
<i>Water</i> contains in it a very considerable Quantity of terrestrial
Matter. Now the Question is, to which of these, the Water, or the
Earthly Matter sustain'd in it, Vegetables owe their Growth and Augment:
For deciding of which, I conceive the following Experiments may afford
some Light; and I can safely say, they were made with due Care and
Exactness.</p>

<h4><i>Anno</i> 1691.</h4>

<p>I chose several <i>Glass Vials</i>, that were all, as near as
possible, of the same shape and bigness. After I had put what Water I
thought fit into every one of them, and taken an Account of the weight
of it, I strain'd and ty'd over the Orifice of each Vial, a Piece of
Parchment, having an hole in the middle of it, large enough to admit the
Stem of the Plant I design'd to set in the Vial, without confining or
streightning it, so as to impede its <i>Growth</i>. My Intention in
this, was to prevent the inclosed Water from evaporating, or ascending
any other way than only through the Plant to be set therein. Then I made
choice of several Sprigs of Mint, and other Plants, that were, as near
as I could possibly judge, alike fresh, sound, and lively. Having taken
the weight of each, I placed it in a Vial, order'd as above; and as the
Plant imbib'd and drew off the Water, I took care to add more of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
same from time to time, keeping an Account of the weight of all I added.
Each of the Glasses were, for better distinction, and the more easie
keeping a Register of all Circumstances, noted with a different Mark or
<i>Letter</i>, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> and all set in a
Row in the same Window, in such manner that all might partake alike of
<i>Air</i>, <i>Light</i>, and <i>Sun</i>. Thus they continued from
<i>July</i> the Twentieth, to <i>October</i> the Fifth, which was just
Seventy Seven Days. Then I took them out, weigh'd the Water in each
Vial, and the Plant likewise, adding to its weight that of all the
Leaves that had fallen off during the time it stood thus. And Lastly, I
computed how much each Plant had gain'd; and how much Water was spent
upon it. The Particulars are as follow.</p>

<div class="record">

<p class="gap-above">(A.) <i>Common Spear-Mint</i>, set in
<i>Spring-Water</i>. The Planted weighed when put in, <i>July</i> 20.
just 27 Grains; when taken forth, <i>October</i> 5. 42 Grains: So that
in this space of 77 Days, it had gained in weight 15 Grains.</p>

<p>The whole Quantity of Water expended, during these 77 Days, amounted
to 2558 Grains. Consequently the weight of the Water taken up, was
170<sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> times as much as the Plant had got
in weight.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(B.) <i>Common Spear-Mint</i>, <i>Rain-Water</i>.
The Mint weigh'd, when put in, Gr. 28¼; when taken out Gr. 45¾, having
gain'd in 77 Days Gr. 17½.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
The Dispendium of the Water Gr. 3004, which was
171<sup>22</sup>&frasl;<sub>35</sub> times as much as the Plant had
received in weight.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(C.) <i>Common Spear-Mint</i>, <i>Thames-water</i>.
The Plant when put in, Gr. 28, when taken forth, Gr. 54. So that in 77
Days it had gained Gr. 26.</p>

<p>The Water expended, amounted to Gr. 2493. which was
95<sup>23</sup>&frasl;<sub>26</sub> times as much as the additional
weight of the Mint.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(D.) <i>Common Solanum</i>, or <i>Night-shade</i>:
<i>Spring-water</i>. The Plant weigh'd, when put in, Gr. 49; when taken
out, 106; having gain'd in 77 Days 57 Gr.</p>

<p>The Water expended during the said time, was 3708 Gr. which was
65<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>57</sub> times as much as the Augment of the
Plant.</p>

<p><i>This Specimen</i> had several <i>Buds</i> upon it, when first set
in the Water. <i>These</i> in some Days became fair <i>Flowers</i>,
which were at length succeeded by <i>Berries</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(E.) <i>Lathyris seu Cataputia Gerh.</i>
<i>Spring-Water.</i> It weigh'd, when put in, Gr. 98. when taken forth,
Gr. 101½. The additional weight for the whole 77 Days, being but Gr.
3½.</p>

<p>The Quantity of Water spent upon it during that time, Gr. 2501. which
is 714<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> times as much as the Plant was
augmented.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Several <strong>other Plants</strong> were try'd, that
did <strong>not thrive</strong> in <strong>Water</strong>, or succeed
any better than the <strong>Cataputia</strong> foregoing:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
But 'tis besides my purpose to give a particular
<strong>Account</strong> of them here.</p>

<div class="record">

<p class="gap-above">(F, G.) <i>These Two Vials</i> were fill'd, the
former (F) with <i>Rain</i>, the other with <i>Spring-water</i>, at the
same time as those above-mention'd were; and stood as long as they did.
But they had neither of them any Plant; my Design in these being only to
inform my self, whether any Water exhaled out of the Glasses, otherwise
than <i>thorow</i> the Bodies of the Plants. The Orifices of these two
Glasses were cover'd with Parchment; each piece of it being perforated
with an hole of the same bigness with those of the Vials above. In this
I suspended a bit of Stick, about the thickness of the Stem of one of
the aforesaid Plants, but not reaching down to the Surface of the
included Water. I put them in thus, that the Water in these might not
have more Scope to evaporate than that in the other Vials. Thus they
stood the whole 77 Days in the same Window with the rest; when, upon
Examination, I found none of the Water in these wasted or gone off. Tho'
I observed both in these, and the rest, especially after hot Weather,
small Drops of Water, not unlike Dew, adhering to the Insides of the
Glasses, that Part of them, I mean, that was above the Surface of the
enclosed Water.</p>

<p>The Water in these two Glasses that had no Plants in them, at the end
of the Experiment, exhibited a larger Quantity of Terrestrial Matter
than that in any of those that had the Plants in them did. The Sediment
at the bottom of the Vials was greater; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
<i>Nubeculæ</i>, diffus'd through the Body of the Water, thicker. And of
that which was in the others, some of it proceeded from certain small
Leaves that had fallen from that part of the Stems of the Plants that
was within the Water, wherein they rotted and dissolved. The Terrestrial
Matter in the Rain-water was finer than that in the Spring-water.</p>

</div>

<h4><i>Anno</i> 1692.</h4>

<p>The Glasses made use of in this, were of the same sort with those in
the former Experiment; and cover'd over with Parchment in like manner.
The Plants here were all <i>Spear-Mint</i>; the most kindly, fresh,
sprightly Shoots I could chuse. The Water, and the Plants were weigh'd
as above; and the Vials set in a Line, in a South Window: where they
stood from <i>June</i> the 2d to <i>July</i> 28. which was just 56
Days.</p>

<div class="record">

<p class="gap-above">(H.) <i>Hyde-Park Conduit Water</i>, alone. The
<i>Mint</i> weighed, when put in, 127 Gr. when taken out, 255 Gr. The
whole Quantity of Water expended upon this Plant, amounted to 14190
Gr.</p>

<p>This was all along a very kindly Plant; and had run up to above two
Foot in height. It had shot but one considerable collateral Branch; but
had sent forth many and long Roots, from which sprung very numerous,
though small and short, lesser Fibres. These lesser Roots came out of
the larger on two opposite sides, for the most part; so that each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Root, with its <i>Fibrillæ</i>, appear'd not unlike a small Feather. To
these <i>Fibrillæ</i> adher'd pretty must Terrestrial Matter. In the
Water, which was at last thick and turbid, was a green Substance,
resembling a fine thin <i>Conserva</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(I.) The <i>same Water</i>, alone. The <i>Mint</i>
weigh'd, when put in, 110 Gr. when taken out, 249. Water expended, 13140
Gr.</p>

<p>This Plant was as kindly as the former, but had shot no collateral
Branches. Its Roots, the Water, and the green Substance, all much as in
the former.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(K.) <i>Hyde-Park Conduit-water</i>, in which was
dissolved an Ounce and half of <i>Common Garden-earth</i>. The
<i>Mint</i> weigh'd, when put in, 76 Gr. when taken out, 244 Gr. Water
expended, Gr. 10731.</p>

<p>This Plant, though it had the Misfortune to be annoy'd with many
small Insects that hapn'd to fix upon it; yet had shot very considerable
collateral Branches; and at least as many Roots as either that in H or
I; which had a much greater Quantity of Terrestrial Matter adhering to
the Extremities of them. The same green Substance here, that was in the
two preceding.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(L.) <i>Hyde-Park Water</i>, with the same Quantity
of <i>Garden-mould</i> as in the former. The <i>Mint</i> weigh'd, when
put in, 92 Gr. when taken out, 376 Gr. The Water expended 14950 Gr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span></p>

<p>This Plant was far more flourishing than any of the precedent; had
several very considerable collateral Branches, and very numerous Roots,
to which Terrestrial Matter adhered very copiously.</p>

<p>The Earth in both these Glasses was very sensibly and considerably
wasted, and less than when first put in. The same sort of green
Substance here as in those above.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(M.) <i>Hyde-Park Water</i>, distilled off with a
gentle Still. The <i>Mint</i> weigh'd, when put in, 114 Gr. when taken
out 155. The Water expended, 8803 Gr.</p>

<p>This Plant was pretty kindly; had two small collateral Branches, and
several Roots, though not so many as that in H or I, but as much
Terrestrial Matter adhering to them as those had. The Water was pretty
thick; having very numerous small Terrestrial Particles swimming in it,
and some Sediment at the bottom of the Glass. This Glass had none of the
green Matter above mentioned, in it.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(N.) The Residue of the Water, which remain'd in
the <i>Still</i> after that in M, was distill'd off. It was very turbid,
and as high-colour'd (reddish) as ordinary Beer. The <i>Mint</i>
weigh'd, when put in, 81 Gr. when taken out, 175 Gr. Water expended,
4344 Gr. This Plant was very lively; and had sent out six collateral
Branches, and several Roots.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(O.) <i>Hyde-Park Conduit-water</i>, in which was
dissolved a Drachm of Nitre. The Mint set in this suddenly began to
wither and decay;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
and died in a few Days: As likewise did two more Sprigs, that were set
in it, successively. In another Glass I dissolv'd an Ounce of good
Garden-mould, and a Drachm of Nitre, and in a third, half an Ounce of
Wood ashes, and a Drachm of Nitre; but the Plants in these succeeded no
better than in the former. In other Glasses I dissolved several other
sorts of Earths, Clays, Marles, and variety of Manures, <i>&amp;c.</i> I set
Mint in distill'd Mint-water; and other Experiments I made, of several
kinds, in order to get Light and Information, what hastened or retarded,
promoted or impeded Vegetation; but these do not belong to the Head I am
now upon.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(P.) <i>Hyde-Park Conduit-water.</i> In this I
fix'd a Glass-Tube about ten Inches long, the Bore about one sixth of an
Inch in Diameter, fill'd with very fine and white Sand, which I kept
from falling down out of the Tube into the Vial, by tying a thin piece
of Silk over that end of the Tube that was downwards. Upon Immersion of
the lower end of it into the Water, this by little and little ascended
quite to the upper Orifice of the Tube. And yet, in all the fifty six
Days which it stood thus, a very inconsiderable Quantity of Water had
gone off, <i>viz.</i> scarce twenty Grains; though the Sand continued
moist up to the top till the very last. The Water had imparted a green
Tincture to the Sand, quite to the very top of the Tube. And, in the
Vial, it had precipitated a greenish Sediment, mix'd with black. To the
bottom and sides of the Tube, as far as 'twas immers'd in the Water,
adher'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
pretty much of the green Substance describ'd above. Other like Tubes I
fill'd with Cotton, Lint, Pith of Elder, and several other porous
Vegetable Substances; setting some of them in clear Water; others in
Water tinged with Saffron, Cochinele, <i>&amp;c.</i> And several other
Trials were made, in order to give a mechanical Representation of the
motion and distribution of the Juices in Plants; and of some other
<i>Phænomena</i> observable in Vegetation, which I shall not give the
Particulars of here, as being not of use to my present design.</p>

<p class="gap-above">(Q, R, S, <i>&amp;c.</i>) Several Plants set in Vials,
ordered in like manner as those above, in <i>October</i>, and the
following colder Months. These throve not near so much; nor did the
Water ascend in nigh the quantity it did in the better Seasons, in which
the before recited Trials were made.</p>

</div>

<h4><i>Some Reflections upon the foregoing Experiments.</i></h4>

<p>1. <i>In Plants of the same kind, the less they are in Bulk, the
smaller the Quantity of the fluid Mass, in which they are set, is drawn
off; the Dispendium of it, where the Mass is of equal thickness, being
pretty nearly proportion'd to the Bulk, of the Plant.</i> Thus that in
the Glass mark'd A, which weigh'd only 27 Grains, drew off but 2558
Grains of the Fluid; and that in B, which weigh'd only 28¼, took up but
3004 Grains; whereas that in H, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
weigh'd 127 Grains, spent 14190 Grains of the Liquid Mass.</p>

<p>The Water seems to ascend up the <i>Vessels</i> of Plants, in much
the same manner as up a Filtre; and 'tis no great wonder that a larger
Filtre should draw off more Water than a lesser; or that a Plant that
has more and larger Vessels, should take up a greater share of the Fluid
in which it is set, than one that has fewer and smaller ones can. Nor do
I note this as a thing very considerable in it self, but chiefly in
regard to what I am about to offer beneath; and that it may be seen
that, in my other Collations of Things, I made due Allowance for this
Difference.</p>

<p class="gap-above">2. <i>The much greatest part of the fluid Mass,
that is thus drawn off and convey'd into the Plants, does not settle or
abide there; but passes through the pores of them, and exhales up into
the Atmosphere.</i> That the Water in these Experiments ascended only
through the Vessel of the Plants, is certain. The <i>Glasses</i> F and
G, that had no Plants in them, though disposed of in like manner as the
rest, remain'd at the End of the Experiment, as at first; and none of
the Water was gone off. And that the greatest part of it flies off from
the Plant into the Atmosphere, is as certain. The least Proportion of
the Water expended, was to the Augment of the Plant, as 46 or 50 to 1.
And in some the weight of the Water drawn off, was 100, 200, nay, in one
above 700 times as much as the Plant had received of Addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
This so continual an Emission and Detachment of Water, in so great
Plenty from the Parts of Plants, affords us a manifest Reason why
Countries that abound with Trees, and the larger Vegetables especially,
should be very obnoxious to Damps, great Humidity in the Air, and more
frequent Rains, than others that are more open and free. The great
Moisture in the Air, was a mighty inconvenience and annoyance to those
who first settled in <i>America</i>; which at that time was much
overgrown with Woods and Groves. But as these were burnt and destroy'd,
to make way for Habitation and Culture of the Earth, the Air mended and
clear'd up apace, changing into a Temper much more dry and serene than
before.</p>

<p>Nor does this Humidity go off pure and alone; but usually bears forth
with it many Parts of the same Nature with those whereof the Plant,
through which it passes, consists. The <i>Crasser</i> indeed are not so
easily born up into the Atmosphere; but are usually deposited on the
Surface of the Flowers, Leaves, and other Parts of the Plants: Hence
comes our Manna's, our Honeys, and other Gummous Exsudations of
Vegetables. But the finer and lighter Parts are with greater ease sent
up into the Atmosphere. Thence they are conveyed to our Organs of Smell,
by the Air we draw in Respiration; and are pleasant or offensive,
beneficent or injurious to us, according to the Nature of the Plants
from whence they arise. And since these owe their Rise to the Water,
that ascends out of the Earth through the Bodies of Plants, we cannot be
far to seek for the Cause why they are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
numerous in the Air, and we find a greater quantity of Odors exhaling
from Vegetables, in warm, humid Seasons, than in any other whatever.</p>

<p class="gap-above">3. <i>A great part of the Terrestrial Matter that
is mix'd with the Water, ascends up into the Plant as well as the
Water.</i> There was much more Terrestrial Matter at the end of the
Experiment, in the Water of the Glasses F and G, that had no Plants in
them, than in those that had Plants. The <i>Garden-mould</i> dissolved
in the Glasses K and L, was considerably diminished, and carried off.
Nay, the Terrestrial and Vegetable Matter was born up in the Tubes
fill'd with Sand, Cotton, <i>&amp;c.</i> in that Quantity, as to be evident
even to Sense. And the Bodies in the Cavities of the other Tubes, that
had their lower Ends immers'd in Water, wherein Saffron, Cochinele,
<i>&amp;c.</i> had been infused, were tinged with Yellow, Purple,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>If I may be permitted to look abroad a while, towards our Shores and
Parts within the Verge of the Sea, these will present us with a large
Scene of Plants, that, along with the Vegetable, take up into them meer
mineral Matter also in great abundance. Such are our Sea-Purslains, the
several sorts of <i>Alga's</i>, of Sampires, and other marine Plants.
These contain common Sea-salt, which is all one with the <i>Fossil</i>,
in such plenty, as not only to be plainly distinguish'd on the Palate,
but may be drawn forth of them in considerable Quantity. Nay, there want
not those who affirm, there are Plants found that will yield
<i>Nitre</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
and other mineral Salts; of which indeed I am not so far satisfied, that
I can depend on the Thing, and therefore give this only as an hint for
Enquiry.</p>

<p>To go on with the Vegetable Matter, how apt and how much disposed
this, being so very fine and light, is to attend Water in all its
Motions, and follow it into each of its Recesses, is manifest, not only
from the Instances above alledg'd, but many others. Percolate it withal
the Care imaginable: Filter it with never so many Filtrations, yet some
Terrestrial Matter will remain. 'Tis true, the Fluid will be thinner
every time than other, and more disingaged of the said Matter; but never
wholly free and clear. I have filtred Water thorough several wholly free
and clear Sheets of thick Paper; and, after that, through very close
fine Cloth twelve times doubled. Nay, I have done this over and over;
and yet a considerable quantity of this Matter discover'd it self in the
Water after all. Now if it thus pass Interstices, that are so very small
and fine along with the Water, 'tis the less strange it should attend it
in its passage through the Ducts and Vessels of Plants. 'Tis true,
filtering and distilling of Water intercepts and makes it quit some of
the Earthy Matter it was before impregnated withal: But then that which
continues with the Water after this, is fine and light; and such
consequently, as is in a peculiar manner fit for the Growth and
Nourishment of Vegetables. And this is the Case of Rain-water. The
Quantity of Terrestrial Matter it bears up into the Atmosphere, is not
great.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
But that which it does bear up, is mainly of that light kind of
Vegetable Matter; and that too perfectly dissolved, and reduced to
single Corpuscles, all fit to enter the Tubules and Vessels of Plants:
On which Account 'tis, that this Water is so very fertile and
prolifick.</p>

<p>The Reason, why in this Proposition, I say, only a great part of the
Terrestrial Matter that is mix'd with the Water, ascends up with it into
the Plant, is, because all of it cannot. The Mineral Matter is a great
deal of it, not only gross and ponderous, but scabrous and inflexible;
and so not disposed to enter the Pores of the Roots. And a great many of
the simple Vegetable Particles by degrees unite, and form some of them
small Clods or <i>Moleculæ</i>; such as those mention'd in H, K, and L,
sticking to the Extremities of the Roots of those Plants. Others of them
intangle in a looser manner; and form the <i>Nubeculæ</i>, and green
Bodies, so commonly observ'd in stagnant Water. These, when thus
conjoin'd, are too big to enter the Pores, or ascend up the Vessels of
Plants, which singly they might have done. They who are conversant in
Agriculture, will easily subscribe to this. They are well aware that, be
their Earth never so rich, so good, and so fit for the production of
Corn or other Vegetables, little will come of it, unless the Parts of it
be separated and loose. 'Tis on this Account they bestow the Pains they
do in Culture of it, in Digging, Plowing, Harrowing, and Breaking of the
Clodded Lumps of Earth. 'Tis the same way that Sea-salt, Nitre, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
other Salts, promote Vegetation. I am sorry I cannot subscribe to the
Opinion of those Learned Gentlemen, who imagine Nitre to be essential to
Plants; and that nothing in the Vegetable Kingdom is transacted without
it. By all the Trials I have been able to make, the thing is quite
otherwise; and when contiguous to the Plant, it rather destroys than
nourishes it. But this Nitre and other Salts certainly do; they loosen
the Earth, and separate the concreted Parts of it; by that means fitting
and disposing them to be assumed by the Water, and carried up into the
Seed or Plant, for its Formation and Augment. There's no Man but must
observe, how apt all sorts of Salts are to be wrought upon by Moisture;
how easily they liquate and run with it; and when these are drawn off,
and have deserted the Lumps wherewith they were incorporated, those must
moulder immediately, and fall asunder of Course. The hardest Stone we
meet with, if it happen, as frequently it does, to have any sort of Salt
intermix'd with the Sand, of which it consists, upon being expos'd to an
humid Air, in a short time dissolves and crumbles all to pieces; and
much more will clodded Earth or Clay, which is not of near so compact
and solid a Constitution as Stone is. The same way likewise is Lime
serviceable in this Affair. The Husbandmen say of it, that it does not
fatten, but only mellows the Ground: By which they mean, that it does
not contain any thing in it self that is of the same Nature with the
Vegetable Mould, or afford any Matter fit for the Formation of Plants; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
meerly softens and relaxes the Earth; by that means rendering it more
capable of entering the Seeds and Vegetables set in it, in order to
their Nourishment, than otherwise it would have been. The Properties of
Lime are well known; and how apt 'tis to be put into Ferment and
Commotion by Water. Nor can such Commotion ever happen when Lime is
mix'd with Earth, however hard and clodded that may be, without opening
and loosening of it.</p>

<p class="gap-above">4. <i>The Plant is more or less nourish'd and
augmented, in Proportion as the Water, in which it stands, contains a
greater or smaller Quantity of proper terrestrial Matter in it.</i> The
Truth of this Proportion is so eminently discernable through the whole
Process of these Trials, that I think no doubt can be made of it. The
<i>Mint</i> in the Glass C, was of much the same Bulk and Weight with
those in A and B. But the Water, in which that was, being River-water,
which was apparently stored more copiously with terrestrial Matter, than
the Spring or Rain-water, wherein they stood, were; it had thriven to
almost double the Bulk that either of them had, and with a less Expence
of Water too. So likewise the Mint in L, in whose Water was dissolved a
small quantity of good Garden-mould, though it had the disadvantage<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
to be less, when first set, than either of the Mints in H or I, whose
Water was the very same with this in L, but had none of that Earth mix'd
with it; yet, in a short time the Plant not only overtook, but much
out-strip'd those and at the end of the Experiment was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
considerably bigger and heavier than either of them. In like manner the
<i>Mint</i> in N, though less at the beginning than that in M, being set
in that thick, turbid, feculent Water, that remained behind, after that
wherein M was placed, was still'd off, had in fine more than double its
original weight and bulk; and receiv'd above twice the additional
Encrease, than that in M, which stood in the thinner distill'd Water,
had done. And, which is not less considerable, had not drawn off half
the Quantity of Water that that had.</p>

<p>Why, in the beginning of this Article, I limit the Proportion of the
Augment of the Plant to the Quantity of proper Terrestrial Matter in the
Water, is, because all, even the Vegetable Matter, to say nothing of the
Mineral, is not proper for the Nourishment of every Plant. There may be,
and doubtless are, some Parts in different Species of Plants, that may
be much alike, and so owe their Supply to the same common Matter; but
'tis plain all cannot. And there are other Parts so differing, that 'tis
no ways credible they should be formed all out of the same sort of
Corpuscles. So far from it, that there want not good Indications, as we
shall see by and by, that every kind of Vegetable requires a peculiar
and specifick Matter for its Formation and Nourishment. Yea, each Part
of the same Vegetable does so; and there are very many and different
Ingredients go to the Composition of the same individual Plant. If
therefore the Soil, wherein any Vegetable or Seed is planted, contains
all or most of these ingredients, and those in due quantity, it will
grow and thrive there; otherwise 'twill not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
If there be not as many sorts of Corpuscles as are requisite for the
Constitution of the main and more essential Parts of the Plant, 'twill
not prosper at all. If there be these, and not in sufficient Plenty,
'twill starve, and never arrive to its natural Stature: Or if there be
any the less necessary and essential Corpuscles wanting, there will be
some failure in the Plant; 'twill be defective in Taste, in Smell, in
Colour, or some other way. But though a Tract of Land may happen not to
contain Matter proper for the Constitution of some one peculiar kind of
Plant; yet it may for several others, and those much differing among
themselves. The Vegetative Particles are commix'd and blended in the
Earth, with all the diversity and variety, as well as all the
uncertainty, conceivable. I have given some intimations of this
elsewhere<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>,
and shall not repeat them here, but hope in due time to put them into a
much better Light than that they there stand in.</p>

<p>It is not possible to imagine, how one uniform, homogeneous Matter,
having its Principles or Original Parts all of the same Substance,
Constitution, Magnitude, Figure, and Gravity, should ever constitute
Bodies so egregiously unlike, in all those respects, as Vegetables of
different kinds are; nay, even as the different Parts of the same
Vegetable. That one should carry a resinous, another a milky, a third a
yellow, a fourth a red Juice, in its Veins; one afford a fragrant,
another an offensive Smell; one be sweet to the Taste, another bitter,
acid, acerbe, austere, &amp;c. that one should be nourishing, another
poisonous, one purging, another astringent: In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
brief, that there should be that vast difference in them, in their
several Constitutions, Makes, Properties, and Effects, and yet all arise
from the very same sort of Matter, would be very strange. And, to note
by the by, this Argument makes equally strong against those, who suppose
meer Water the Matter, out of which all Bodies are form'd.</p>

<p>The <i>Cataputia</i> in the Glass E, received but very little
Encrease, only three Grains and an half all the while it stood, though
2501 Grains of Water were spent upon it. I will not say the Reason was,
because that Water did not contain in it Matter fit and proper for the
Nourishment of that peculiar and remarkable Plant. No, it may be the
Water was not a proper <i>Medium</i> for it to grow in; and we know
there are very many Plants that will not thrive in it. Too much of that
Liquor, in some Plants, may probably hurry the Terrestrial Matter
thorough their Vessels too fast for them to arrest and lay hold of it.
Be that as it will, 'tis most certain there are peculiar Soils that suit
particular Plants. In <i>England</i>, Cherries are observ'd to succeed
best in <i>Kent</i>; Apples in <i>Herefordshire</i>; Saffron in
<i>Cambridgeshire</i>; Wood in two or three of our <i>Midland
Counties</i>; and Teazles in <i>Somersetshire</i>. This is an
Observation that hath held in all Parts, and indeed in all Ages of the
World. The most ancient Writers of Husbandry<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
took notice of it; and are not wanting in their Rules for making choice
of Soils suited to the Nature of each kind of Vegetable they thought
valuable, or worth propagating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
But, which is a further Proof of what I am here endeavouring to advance,
that Soil that is once proper and fit for the Production of some one
sort of Vegetable, does not ever continue to be so. No, in Tract of time
it loses that Property; but sooner in some Lands, and later in others:
This is what all who are conversant in these things know very well. If
Wheat, for Example, be sown upon a Tract of Land that is proper for that
Grain, the first Crop will succeed very well; and perhaps the second,
and the third, as long as the Ground is in Heart, as the Farmers speak;
but in a few Years 'twill produce no more, if sowed with that Corn: Some
other Grain indeed it may, as Barley. And after this has been sown so
often, that the Land can bring forth no more of the same, it may
afterwards yield good Oats; and, perhaps, Pease after them. At length
'twill become barren; the Vegetative Matter, that at first it abounded
withal, being educed forth of it by those successive Crops, and most of
it born off. Each sort of Grain takes forth that peculiar Matter that is
proper for its own Nourishment. First, the Wheat draws off those
Particles that suit the Body of that Plant; the rest lying all quiet and
undisturbed the while. And when the Earth has yielded up all them, those
that are proper for Barley, a different Grain, remain still behind, till
the successive Crops of that Corn fetch them forth too. And so the Oats
and Pease, in their Turn; till in fine all is carried off, and the Earth
in great measure drain'd of that sort of Matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
After all which, that very Tract of Land may be brought to produce
another Series of the same Vegetables; but never till 'tis supplied with
a new Fund of Matter, of like sort with that it at first contain'd. This
Supply is made several ways: By the Grounds lying fallow for some time,
till the Rain has pour'd down a fresh Stock upon it: <i>Or</i>, by the
Tiller's Care in manuring of it. And for farther Evidence that this
Supply is in reality of like sort, we need only reflect a while upon
those Manures that are found by constant Experience best to promote
Vegetation, and the Fruitfulness of the Earth. These are chiefly either
parts of Vegetables, or of Animals; which indeed either derive their own
Nourishment immediately from Vegetable Bodies, or from other Animals
that do so. In particular, the Blood, Urine, and Excrements of Animals;
Shavings of Horns, and of Hoofs; Hair, Wool, Feathers; calcin'd Shells;
Lees of Wine, and of Beer; Ashes of all sorts of Vegetable Bodies;
Leaves, Straw, Roots, and Stubble, turn'd into the Earth by Plowing or
otherwise to rot and dissolve there: These, I say, are our best Manures;
and, being Vegetable Substances, when refunded back again into the
Earth, serve for the Formation of other like Bodies.</p>

<p>Not wholly to confine our Thoughts to the Fields, let us look a while
into our Gardens; where we shall meet with still further Confirmations
of the same thing. The Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs cultivated in these,
after they have continued in one Station, till they have derived thence
the greater part of the Matter fit for their Augment, will decay and
degenerate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
unless either fresh Earth, or some fit Manure, be applied unto them.
'Tis true, they may maintain themselves there for some time, by sending
forth Roots further and further to a great Extent all round, to fetch in
more remote Provision; but at last all will fail; and they must either
have a fresh Supply brought to them, or they themselves be removed and
transplanted to some Place better furnished with Matter for their
Subsistence. And accordingly <i>Gardiners</i> observe, that Plants that
have stood a great while in a Place, have longer Roots than usual; part
of which they cut off, when they transplant them to a fresh Soil, as now
not of any further use to them. All these Instances, to pass over a
great many others that might be alledg'd, point forth a particular
Terrestrial Matter, and not Water, for the Subject to which Plants owe
their Increase. Were it Water only, there would be no need of Manures;
or of transplanting them from place to place. The Rain falls in all
Places alike; in this Field and in that indifferently; in one side of an
Orchard or Garden, as well as another. Nor could there be any Reason,
why a Tract of Land should yield Wheat one Year, and not the next; since
the Rain showers down alike in each. But I am sensible I have carried on
this Article to too great a length; which yet on so ample and extensive
a Subject, 'twas not easie to avoid.</p>

<p class="gap-above">5. <i>Vegetables are not form'd of Water; but of a
certain peculiar Terrestrial Matter.</i> It hath been shewn, that there
is a considerable Quantity of this Matter contain'd both in Rain,

Spring, and River-water: That the much greatest part of the fluid Mass
that ascends up into Plants, does not settle or abide there, but passes
through the Pores of them, and <i>exhales</i> up into the Atmosphere;
That a great part of the Terrestrial Matter, mix'd with the Water,
passes up into the Plant along with it; and that the Plant is more or
less augmented in proportion, as the Water contains a greater or smaller
Quantity of that Matter. From all which we may very reasonably infer,
that <i>Earth, and not Water, is the Matter that constitutes
Vegetables</i>. The Plant in E, drew up into it 2501 Grains of the fluid
Mass; and yet had received but Grains 3 and a half of Increase from all
that. The Mint in L, though it had at first the disadvantage to be much
less than that in I; yet being set in Water wherewith Earth was
plentifully mix'd, and <i>that</i> in I, <i>only in Water</i> without
any such additional Earth, it had vastly outgrown the other, weighing at
last 145 Grains more than that did, and so having gain'd about twice as
much as that had. In like manner that in K, though 'twas a great deal
less when put in than that in I, and also was impair'd and offended by
Insects; yet being planted in Water wherein Earth was dissolved, whereas
the Water in which it stood had none, it not only over-took, but
considerably surpass'd the other; weighing at last 29 Grains more than
that in I, and yet had not expended so much Water as that, by above 2400
Grains. The Plant in N, tho' at first a great deal less than that in M;
yet being set in the foul crass Water that was left in the Still, after
that, in which M was set, was drawn off, in Conclusion had gain'd in
weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
above double what that in the finer and thinner Water had. The
Proportion of the Augment of that Plant that throve most was, to the
fluid Mass spent upon it, but as 1 to 46. In others, 'twas but as 1 to
60, 100, 200; nay, in the <i>Cataputia</i>, 'twas but as 1 to 714. The
Mint in B took up 39 Grains of Water a-day, one day with another; which
was much more than the whole weight of the Plant originally; and yet,
with all this, it gain'd not one fourth of a Grain a-day in weight. Nay,
that in H took up 253 Grains a day of the Fluid: Which was near twice as
much as its original Weight, it weighing, when first set in the Water,
but 127 Grains. And, after all, the daily Encrease of the Plant was no
more than Grains 2<sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>56</sub>.</p>

<p class="gap-above">6. <i>Spring, and Rain-water, contain pretty near
an equal Charge of Vegetable Matter</i>; <i>River-water more than either
of them.</i> The Plants in the Glasses A, B, and C, were at first of
much the same size and weight. At the End of the Experiment, the Mint in
A had gain'd 15 Grains out of 2558 Grains of Spring-water; that in B,
Grains 17 and an half, out of 3004 Grains of Rain-water; but that in C
had got 26 Grains out of only 2493 Grains of River-water. I do not found
this Proposition solely upon these Trials; having made some more, which
I do not relate here, that agree well enough with these. So that the
Proportions here deliver'd, will hold for the main; but a strict and
just Comparison is hardly to be expected. So far from it, that I make no
doubt, but the Water that falls in Rain, at some times, contains a
greater share of Terrestrial Matter than that which falls at others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
A more powerful and intense Heat must needs hurry up a larger quantity
of that Matter along with the humid Vapours that form Rain, than one
more feeble and remiss ever possibly can. The Water of one Spring may
flow forth with an higher Charge of this Matter, than that of another;
this depending partly upon the quickness of the Ebullition of the Water,
and partly upon the Quantity of that Matter latent in the <i>Strata</i>,
through which the Fluid passes, and the greater or less laxity of those
<i>Strata</i>. For the same Reason, the Water of one River may abound
with it more than that of another. Nay, the same River, when much
agitated, and in commotion, must bear up more of it, than when it moves
with less rapidity and violence. That there is a great Quantity of this
Matter in Rivers; and that it contributes vastly to the ordinary
Fertility of the Earth, we have an illustrious Instance in the
<i>Nile</i>, the <i>Ganges</i>, and other Rivers that yearly overflow
the neighbouring Plains. Their Banks shew the fairest and largest Crops
of any in the whole World. They are even loaded with the multitude of
their Productions; and those who have not seen them, will hardly be
induced to believe the mighty Returns those Tracts make in comparison of
others, that have not the Benefit of like Inundations.</p>

<p class="gap-above">7. <i>Water serves only for a Vehicle to the
Terrestrial Matter, which forms Vegetables; and does not it self make
any addition unto them.</i> Where the proper Terrestrial Matter is
wanting, the Plant is not augmented, though never so much Water ascend
into it. The <i>Cataputia</i> in E, took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
up more Water than the Mint in C, and yet had grown but very little,
having received only three Grains and an half of additional weight;
whereas the other had received no less than twenty six Grains. The Mint
in I, was planted in the same sort of Water as that in K, was; only the
latter had Earth dissolved in the Water; and yet that drew off 13140
Grains of the Water, gaining it self no more than 139 Grains in weight;
whereas the other took up but 10731 Grains of the Water, and was
augmented 168 Grains in weight. Consequently that spent 2409 Grains more
of the Water than this in K, did, and yet was not so much encreased in
weight as this by 29 Grains. The Mint in M, stood in the very same kind
of Water as that in N, did. But the Water in M, having much less
Terrestrial Matter in it than that in N had, the Plant bore up 8803
Grains of it, gaining it self only 41 Grains the while; whereas that in
N drew off no more than 4344 Grains, and yet was augmented 94 Grains. So
that it spent 4459 Grains of Water more than that did; and yet was not
it self so much increased in weight, as that was, by 53 Grains. This is
both a very fair, and a very conclusive Instance; on which Account 'tis
that I make oftner use of it. Indeed they are all so; and to add any
thing further on this Head, will not be needful.</p>

<p>'Tis evident therefore Water is not the Matter that composes
Vegetable Bodies. 'Tis only the Agent that conveys that Matter to them;
that introduces and distributes it to their several Parts for their
Nourishment. That Matter is sluggish and unactive, and would lie
eternally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
confin'd to its Beds of Earth, without ever advancing up into Plants,
did not Water, or some like Instrument, fetch it forth and carry it unto
them. That therefore there is that plentiful Provision, and vast
Abundance of it supplied to all Parts of the Earth, is a mark of a
natural Providence superintending over the Globe we inhabit; and
ordaining a due Dispensation of that Fluid, without the Ministry of
which the Noble Succession of Bodies we behold, <i>Animals</i>,
<i>Vegetables</i>, and <i>Minerals</i>, would be all at a stand<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>.
But to keep to Plants, 'tis manifest Water, as well on this, as upon the
other Hypothesis, is absolutely necessary in the Affair of Vegetation;
and it will not succeed without it: Which indeed gave occasion to the
Opinion, that Water it self nourished, and was changed into Vegetable
Bodies. They saw, though these were planted in a Soil never so rich, so
happy, so advantageous, nothing came of it unless there was Water too in
a considerable quantity. And it must be allow'd Vegetables will not come
on or prosper where that is wanting: But yet what those Gentlemen
inferr'd thence, was not, we see, well grounded.</p>

<p>This Fluid is capacitated for the Office here assign'd it several
ways: By the Figure of its Parts, which, as appears from many
Experiments, is exactly and mathematically Spherical; their Surfaces
being perfectly polite, and without any the least Inequalities. 'Tis
evident, Corpuscles of such a Figure are easily susceptible of Motion,
yea, far above any others whatever;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
and consequently the most capable of moving and conveying other Matter,
that is not so active and voluble. Then the Intervals of Bodies of that
Figure are, with respect to their Bulk, of all others the largest; and
so the most fitted to receive and entertain foreign Matter in them.
Besides, as far as the Trials hitherto made inform us, the constituent
Corpuscles of Water are, each singly consider'd, absolutely solid; and
do not yield to the greatest External Force. This secures their Figure
against any Alteration; and the Intervals of the Corpuscles must be
always alike. By the latter, 'twill be ever disposed to receive Matter
into it; and by the former, when once received, to bear it on along with
it. Water is further capacitated to be a Vehicle to this Matter, by the
tenuity and fineness of the Corpuscles of which it consists. We hardly
know any Fluid in all Nature, except Fire, whose constituent Parts are
so exceeding subtle and small as those of Water are. They'll pass Pores
and Interstices, that neither Air nor any other Fluid will. This enables
them to enter the finest Tubes and Vessels of Plants, and to introduce
the Terrestrial Matter, conveying it to all Parts of them; whilst each,
by means of Organs 'tis endowed with for the Purpose, intercepts and
assumes into it self such Particles as are suitable to its own Nature,
letting the rest pass on through the common Ducts. Nay, we have almost
every where Mechanical Instances of much the same Tenor. 'Tis obvious to
every one, how easily and suddenly Humidity, or the Corpuscles of Water
sustained in the Air, pervade and insinuate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
themselves into Cords, however tightly twisted, into Leather, Parchment,
Vegetable Bodies, Wood, and the like. This it is that fits them for
<i>Hygrometers</i>; and to measure and determine the different
quantities of Moisture in the Air, in different Places and Seasons. How
freely Water passes and carries with it Terrestrial Matter, through
Filtres, Colatures, Distillations, <i>&amp;c.</i> hath been intimated
already.</p>

<p class="gap-above">8. <i>Water is not capable of performing this
Office to Plants, unless assisted by a due Quantity of Heat; and this
must concur, or Vegetation will not succeed.</i> The Plants that were
set in the Glasses Q, R, S, <i>&amp;c.</i> in <i>October</i>, and the
following colder Months, had not near the quantity of Water sent up into
them, or so great an additional Encrease by much, as those that were set
in <i>June</i>, <i>July</i>, and the hotter. 'Tis plain Water has no
power of moving it self; or rising to the vast height it does in the
more tall and lofty Plants. So far from this, that it does not appear
from any Discovery yet made, that even its own Fluidity consists in the
intestine Motion of its Parts; whatever some, otherwise very learned and
knowing, Persons may have thought. There is no need of any thing more,
for solving all the <i>Phænomena</i> of Fluidity, than such a Figure and
Disposition of the Parts, as Water has. Corpuscles of that make, and
that are all absolutely Spherical, must stand so very tickle and nicely
upon each other, as to be susceptible of every Impression; and though
not perpetually in Motion, yet must be ever ready and liable to be put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
into it, by any the slightest Force imaginable. It is true, the Parts of
Fire or Heat are not capable of moving themselves any more than those of
Water; but they are more subtil, light, and active, than those are, and
so more easily put into Motion. In fine, 'tis evident and matter of
Fact, that Heat does operate upon, and move the Water, in order to its
carrying on the Work of Vegetation: But how 'tis agitated it self, and
where the Motion first begins, this is no fit Place to enquire.</p>

<p>That the Concourse of Heat in this Work is really necessary, appears,
not only from the Experiments before us, but from all Nature; from our
Fields and Forests, our Gardens and our Orchards. We see in
<i>Autumn</i>, as the Sun's Power grows gradually less and less, so its
Effects on Plants is remitted, and their Vegetation slackens by little
and little. Its Failure is first discernible in Trees. These are raised
highest above the Earth; and require a more intense Heat to elevate the
Water, charged with their Nourishment, to the Tops and Extremities of
them. So that for want of fresh Support and Nutriment, they shed their
Leaves, unless secur'd by a very firm and hardy Constitution indeed, as
our <i>ever-Greens</i> are. Next the Shrubs part with theirs; and then
the Herbs and lower Tribes; the Heat being at length not sufficient to
supply even these, though so near the Earth, the Fund of their
Nourishment. As the Heat returns the succeeding Spring, they all recruit
again; and are furnish'd with fresh Supplies and Verdure: But first,
those which are lowest and nearest the Earth, Herbs, and they that
require a lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
degree of Heat to raise the Water with its Earthy Charge into them: Then
the Shrubs and higher Vegetables in their Turns; and lastly, the Trees.
As the Heat increases, it grows too powerful, and hurries the Matter
with too great Rapidity thorough the finer and more tender Plants: These
therefore go off, and decay; and others that are more hardy and
vigorous, and require a greater share of Heat, succeed in their Order.
By which Mechanism, provident Nature furnishes us with a very various
and differing Entertainment; and what is best suited to each Season, all
the Year round.</p>

<p>As the Heat of the several Seasons affords us a different Face of
Things; so the several distant Climates shew different Scenes of Nature,
and Productions of the Earth<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>.
The Hotter Countries yield ordinarily the largest and tallest Trees; and
those in too much greater variety than the colder ever do. Even those
Plants which are common to both, attain to a much greater Bulk in the
Southern than in the Northern Climes. Nay, there are some Regions so
bleak and chill, that they raise no Vegetables at all to any
considerable Size. This we learn from <i>Greenland</i>, from
<i>Iseland</i>, and other Places of like cold Site and Condition. In
these no Tree ever appears; and the very Shrubs they afford, are few,
little, and low.</p>

<p>Again, in the warmer Climates, and such as do furnish forth Trees and
the larger Vegetables, if there happen a remission or diminution of the
usual Heat, their Productions will be impeded and diminished in
proportion. Our late Colder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
Summers have given us proof enough of this. For though the Heat we have
had, was sufficient to raise the Vegetative Matter into the lower
Plants, into our Corns, our Wheat, Barley, Pease and the like; and we
have had plenty of Straw-berries, Ras-berries, Currans, Goosberries, and
the Fruits of such other Vegetables as are low and near the Earth: Yea,
and a moderate store of Cherries, Mulberries, Plumbs, Filberts, and some
others that grow somewhat at a greater Height; yet our Apples, our
Pears, Walnuts, and the Productions of the taller<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>
Trees have been fewer, and those not so kindly, so thoroughly ripen'd,
and brought to that Perfection they were in the former more benign and
their warm Seasons. Nay, even the lower Fruits and Grains have had some
share in the common Calamity; and fallen short both in Number and
Goodness of what the hotter and kinder Seasons were wont to shew us. As
to our Grapes, Abricots, Peaches, Nectarens, and Figs, being
transplanted hither out of hotter Climes, 'tis the less wonder we have
of late had so general a Failure of them.</p>

<p>Nor is it the Sun, or the ordinary emission of the Subterranean Heat
only, that promotes Vegetation; but any other indifferently, according
to its Power and Degree: This we are taught by our Stoves, hot Beds, and
the like. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
Heat is of like kind; and where-ever is the same Cause, there will be
constantly the same Effect. There's a Procedure in every part of Nature,
that is perfectly regular and geometrical, if we can but find it out;
and the further our Searches carry us, the more shall we have occasion
to admire this, and the better 'twill compensate our Industry.</p>

<h3>An Account of the Measure of the thickness of Gold upon Gilt Wire;
together with Demonstration of the exceeding Minuteness of the Atoms or
constituent Particles of Gold; as it was read before the <strong>Royal
Society</strong>, by <strong>E. Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">WHAT are the constituent Parts of Matter, and how
there comes to be so great a diversity in the weight of Bodies, to all
appearance equally solid and dense, such as are Gold and Glass, (whose
specifick Gravities are nearly as 7 to 1) seems a very hard Question to
those that shall rightly consider it: For from undoubted Experiment,
Gravity is in all Bodies proportionable to the Quantity of Matter in
each; and there is no such thing as a Propension of some more, others
less, towards the Earth's Center; since the Impediment of the Air being
removed, all Bodies descend, be they never so loose or compact in
Texture, with equal Velocity. It follows therefore, That there is 7
times as much Matter in Gold, as in a piece of Glass of the same
Magnitude; and consequently, that at least six parts of seven in the
Bulk of Glass, must be Pore or Vacuity: This some Favourers of the
Atomical Philosophy have endeavoured to solve, by supposing the primary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
or constituent Atoms of Gold to be much larger than those of other
Bodies, and consequently the Pores fewer; whereas in other Bodies, the
great multitude of the interspersed Vacuities does diminish their
Weights.</p>

<p>Being desirous to examine this Notion of the Magnitude of Atoms of
Gold, I bethought my self of the extreme Ductility of that Metal, which
is seen in the beating of it into Leaf, and above all in the drawing
fine Gilt-wire, by means whereof, I believed I might most exactly obtain
the true thickness of the Coat of Gold, that appears, even with the
Microscope, so well to represent Gold it self, that not the least point
of Silver appears through it. In order to this, I inform'd my self among
the Wire-drawers, what Gold they us'd to their Silver; and they told me,
That the very best double Gilt Wire was made out of Cylindrick Ingots, 4
Inches in Circumference, and 28 Inches long, which weigh 16 Pounds Troy;
on these they bestow 4 Ounces of Gold, that is, to every 48 Ounces of
Silver one of Gold; and that two Yards of the super-fine Wire weighs a
Grain. Hence at first sight it appear'd, that the length of 98 Yards is
in weight 49 Grains, and that a single Grain of Gold covers the said 98
Yards, and that the 10000th part of a Grain is above ⅓ of an Inch long;
which yet may be actually divided into 10, and so the 100000th part of a
Grain of Gold be visible without a Microscope. But being desirous to
compute the thickness of the Skin of Gold, by means of the specifick
Gravities of the Metals, viz. Silver 10⅓, and Gold 18⅔, I found the
Diameter of such Wire the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>386</sub> part of an
Inch, and its Circumference the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>123</sub> part; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
the Gold in thickness not to exceed the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>134500</sub>
part of an Inch; whence it may be concluded, that the Cube of the
hundredth part of an Inch would contain above 2433000000, (or the Cube
of 1345) of such Atoms. And it may likewise be marvelled at, that Gold
being stretcht to so great a degree, as is here demonstrated, should yet
shew it self of so even and united a Texture, as not to let the white
Colour of the Silver under it appear through any the least Pores; which
argues, that even in this exceeding thinness very many of those Atoms
may still lie one over the other: Which is a Consideration may merit the
Thoughts of this Honourable Society, as tending to examine that renowned
Atomical Doctrine, which has of late much obtain'd among the Learned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span></p>

<h3>An Account of the several Species of <strong>Infinite
Quantity</strong>, and of the Proportions they bear one to the other; as
it was read before the <strong>Royal Society</strong>, by <strong>E.
Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THAT all Magnitudes infinitely great, or such as
exceed any assignable Quantity, are equal among themselves, though it be
vulgarly received for a Maxim, is not yet so common as it is erroneous;
and the Reason of the mistake seems to be, That the Mind of Man, coming
to contemplate the Extensions of what exceeds the bounds of its
Capacity, and of which the very Idea does include a Negation of Limits;
it comes to pass that we acquiesce generally, and it suffices to say
such a Quantity is infinite.</p>

<p>But if we come more nearly to examine this Notion, we shall find,
that there are really besides infinite <i>Length</i> and infinite
<i>Area</i>, no less than three several sorts of infinite Solidity; all
of which are <i>Quantitates sui generis</i>, having no more relation or
proportion the one to the other, than a Line to a Plane, or a Plane to a
Solid, or a Finite to an Infinite. But that among themselves, each of
those Species of Infinites are in given Proportions, is what I now
intend to make plain, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
But first, infinite Length, or a Line infinitely long, is to be
considered either as beginning at a Point, and so infinitely extended
one way, or else both ways from the same Point; in which case the one,
which is a beginning infinity, is the one half of the whole, which is
the Summ of the beginning and ceasing Infinity; or, as I may say, of
Infinity, <i>à parte ante</i>, and <i>à parte post</i>: Which is
analogous to Eternity in Time or Duration, in which there is always as
much to follow as is past, from any point or moment of Time: Nor doth
the Addition or Subduction of finite Length or Space of time alter the
case either in Infinity or Eternity, since both the one or the other
cannot be any part of the whole.</p>

<p>As to infinite <i>Surface</i> or <i>Area</i>, any right Line,
infinitely extended both ways on an infinite Plane, does divide that
infinite Plane into equal Parts; the one to the right, and the other to
the left of the said Line: But if from any Point in such a Plane, two
right Lines be infinitely extended, so as to make an Angle, the infinite
Area, intercepted between those infinite right Lines, is to the whole
infinite Plane, as the Arch of a Circle, on the Point of Concourse of
those Lines, as a Centre, intercepted between the said Lines, is to the
Circumference of the Circle; or as the Degrees of the Angle to the 360
Degrees of a Circle. For Example, two right Lines meeting at a right
Angle do include, on an infinite Plane, a quarter part of the whole
infinite Area of such a Plane.</p>

<p>But if so be, two parallel infinite Lines be supposed drawn on such
an infinite Plane, the Area intercepted between them will be likewise
infinite; but at the same time will be infinitely less,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
than that Space which is intercepted between two infinite Lines that are
inclined, though with never so small an Angle; for that in the one Case,
the given finite distance of the parallel Lines diminishes the Infinity
in one Degree of Dimension; whereas in a Sector, there is Infinity in
both Dimensions; and consequently, the Quantities are the one infinitely
greater than the other, and there is no proportion between them.</p>

<p>From the same Consideration arise the Three several Species of
infinite Space or Solidity, as has been said; for a Parallelepipede, or
a Cylinder, infinitely long, is greater than any finite Magnitude how
great soever; and all such Solids, supposed to be formed on given Bases,
are as those Bases, in proportion to one another. But if two of these
three Dimensions are wanting, as in the Space intercepted between two
parallel Planes infinitely extended, and at a finite distance; or with
infinite Length and Breadth, with a finite Thickness; All such Solids
shall be as the given finite distances one to another: But these
Quantities, though infinitely greater than the other, are yet infinitely
less than any of those, wherein all the three Dimensions are infinite.
Such are the Spaces intercepted between two inclined Planes infinitely
extended; the Space intercepted by the Surface of a Cone, or the sides
of a Pyramid likewise infinitely continued, <i>&amp;c.</i> of all which
notwithstanding, the Proportions one to another, and to the
<span title="to pan">τὸ πᾶν</span>,
or vast Abyss of infinite Space (wherein is the <i>Locus</i> of all things
that are or can be; or to the Solid of infinite Length, Breadth, and
Thickness, taken all manner of ways) are easily assignable. For the
Space between two Planes, is to the whole, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
the Angle of those Planes to the 360 Degrees of the Circle. As for Cones
and Pyramids, they are as the Spherical Surface, intercepted by them, is
to the Surface of the Sphere; and therefore Cones are as the versed
Sines of half their Angles, to the Diameter of the Circle: These three
sorts of infinite Quantity are analogous to a Line, Surface and Solid,
and after the same manner cannot be compared, or have any proportion the
one to the other.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are several other Species of infinite Quantity,
arising from the Contemplation of Curves, and their Asymptotes; which,
by reason of the difficulty of the Subject, cannot be made so plain to
most Readers: But what has been already said, may be sufficient to
evince what we undertook to explain.</p>

<h3>An Account of Dr. <strong>Robert Hook</strong>'s Invention of the
Marine Barometer, with its Description and Uses; published by order of
the Royal Society, by <strong>E. Halley</strong>, R. S. S.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">SInce it was found that the <i>Torricellian Tube</i>,
commonly call'd the <i>Mercurial Barometer</i>, by the rising and
falling of the <i>Quick-silver</i> therein, doth presage the Changes of
the Air, in relation to fair and foul Weather; upon several Years
Observation of it, it has been proved and adjusted for that purpose by
Dr. <i>Robert Hook</i>; and there have been by him many attempts to
improve the Instrument, and render the Minute Divisions on the Scale
thereof more sensible. He also judging that it might be of great use at
Sea, contrived several ways to make it serviceable on Board of Ship; one
of which he explain'd to the <i>Royal Society</i> at their Weekly
Meeting in <i>Gresham College</i>, <i>January 2. 1667/8</i>. Since which
time he hath further cultivated the Invention, and some Years ago
produced before the said <i>Society</i>, the Instrument I am now to
describe, which for its subtilty and usefulness, seemeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
to surpass all other performances of the like Nature.</p>

<p>'Till such time as the Author's present Indisposition will give him
leave to bestow freely his Thoughts on this Subject upon the Publick, it
is the Opinion of the Society, that such an Account be given of this
Contrivance, as may render it known, and recommend it to the Mariners
use, for which it was principally intended.</p>

<p>The <i>Mercurial Barometer</i> requiring a perpendicular Posture, and
the <i>Quick-silver</i> vibrating therein with great Violence upon any
Agitation, is therefore uncapable of being used at Sea (tho' it hath
lately been contrived to be made portable), so it remain'd to find out
some other Principle, wherein the Position of the Instrument was not so
indispensably necessary: For this, all those that use the Sea are
obliged to the great facility Dr. <i>Hook</i> has always shewn, in
applying Philosophical Experiments to their proper uses.</p>

<p>It is about forty Years since, that the <i>Thermometers</i> of
<i>Robert de Fluctibus</i>, depending on the Dilatation and Contraction
of included Air by Heat and Cold, have been disused, upon discovery that
the Airs pressure is unequal; that inequality mixing it self with the
Effects of the warmth of the Air in that Instrument. And instead thereof
was substituted the seal'd <i>Thermometer</i>, including Spirit of Wine
(first brought into <i>England</i>, out of <i>Italy</i>, by Sir
<i>Robert Southwell</i>) as a proper Standard of the temper of the Air,
in relation to Heat and Cold; that Ætherial Spirit being of all the
known Liquors the most susceptible of Dilatation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
and Contraction, especially with a moderate degree of either Heat or
Cold. Now this being allow'd as a Standard, and the other
<i>Thermometer</i> that includes Air, being graduated with the same
Divisions, so as at the time when the Air was included, to agree with
the Spirit-<i>Thermometer</i> in all the degrees of Heat and Cold,
noting at the same time the precise height of the <i>Mercury</i> in the
common Barometers: It will readily be understood, that whensoever these
two <i>Thermometers</i> shall agree, the pressure of the Air is the same
it was, when the Air was included, and the Instrument graduated: That if
in the Air-<i>Thermometer</i> the Liquor stand higher than the Division
marked thereon, corresponding with that on the Spirit-glass, it is an
indication that there is a greater pressure of the Air at that time,
than when the Instrument was graduated. And the contrary is to be
concluded, when the Air-glass stands lower than the Spirit, <i>viz.</i>
that then the Air is so much lighter, and the <i>Quick silver</i>, in
the ordinary Barometer lower than at the said time of Graduation.</p>

<p>And the Spaces answering to an Inch of <i>Mercury</i>, will be more
or less, according to the quantity of Air so included, and the smallness
of the Glass Cane, in which the Liquor rises and falls, and may be
augmented almost in any proportion, under that of the Specifick Gravity
of the Liquor of the <i>Thermometer</i> to <i>Mercury</i>. So as to have
a Foot or more for an Inch of <i>Mercury</i>, which is another great
convenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
It has been observed by some, that in long keeping this Instrument, the
Air included either finds a means to escape, or deposites some Vapours
mixt with it, or else for some other cause becomes less Elastick,
whereby, in process of time, it gives the height of the <i>Mercury</i>
somewhat greater than it ought; but this, if it should happen in some of
them, hinders not the usefulness thereof, for that it may at any time
very easily be corrected by Experiment, and the rising and falling
thereof are the things chiefly remarkable in it, the just height being
barely a Curiosity.</p>

<p>In these Parts of the World, long Experience has told us, that the
rising of the <i>Mercury</i> forebodes fair Weather after foul, and an
Easterly or Northerly Wind; and that the falling thereof, on the
contrary, signifies Southerly or Westerly Winds, with Rain, or stormy
Winds, or both; which latter it is of much more consequence to provide
against at Sea than at Land; and in a Storm, the <i>Mercury</i>
beginning to rise is a sure sign that it begins to abate, as has been
experienced in high Latitudes, both to the Northwards and Southwards of
the Æquator.</p>

<p>The Form of this Instrument is shown in the Cut, by Tab. 4. Fig. 1.
wherein,</p>

<p>AB represents the Spirit-<i>Thermometer</i>, graduated from 0, or the
freezing Point, through all the possible degrees of the Heat or Cold of
the Air, at least in these Climates.</p>

<p>CD, is the Air-<i>Thermometer</i>, graduated after the same manner
with the like Degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
EF, is a Plate applied to the side of the <i>Thermometer</i> CD,
graduated into Spaces answering to Inches and parts of an Inch of
<i>Mercury</i>, in the common Barometers.</p>

<p>G, a Hand standing on the Plate at the height of the <i>Mercury</i>
thereon, as it was when the Instrument was graduated, as suppose here at
29½ Inches.</p>

<p>LM, a Wire on which the Plate EF, slips up and down, parallel to the
Cane of the <i>Thermometer</i> CD.</p>

<p>K, any Point at which the Spirit stands at the time of Observation;
suppose at 38 on the Spirit-<i>Thermometer</i>; Slide the Plate EF till
the Hand G stand at 38 on the Air-<i>Thermometer</i>, and if the Liquor
therein stand at 38 likewise, then is the pressure of the Air the same
as at the time of Graduation, <i>viz.</i> 29,5; but if it stand higher,
as at 30, at I; then is the pressure of the Air greater; and the
division on the sliding Plate against the Liquor, shews the present
height of the <i>Mercury</i> to be twenty nine Inches seven Tenths. And
this may suffice as to the manner of using it.</p>

<p>I had one of these Barometers with me in my late Southern Voyage, and
it never failed to prognostick and give early notice of all the bad
Weather we had, so that I depended thereon, and made provision
accordingly; and from my own Experience I conclude that a more useful
Contrivance hath not for this long time been offer for the benefit of
Navigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
These Instruments are made according to the Direction of Dr.
<i>Hook</i>, by Mr. <i>Henry Hunt</i>, Operator to the Royal Society,
who will furnish any Gentlemen with them, and give them Directions how
to use them.</p>

<h3>A Discourse concerning the Proportional Heat of the Sun in all
Latitudes, with the Method of collecting the same; as it was read before
the Royal Society, in one of their late Meetings. By <strong>E.
Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THere having lately arisen some Discourse about that
part of the Heat of Weather, simply produced by the Action of the Sun;
and I having affirmed, that if that were considered, as the only Cause
of the Heat of the Weather, I saw no Reason, but that under the Pole the
solstitical Day ought to be as hot as it is under the Æquinoctial, when
the Sun comes vertical, or over the Zenith: For this Reason, that for
all the 24 Hours of that Day under the Pole, the Sun's Beams are
inclined to the Horizon, with an Angle of 23½ Degrees; and under the
Æquinoctial, though he come vertical, yet he shines no more than 12
Hours, and is again 12 Hours absent; and that for 3 Hours 8 Minutes of
that 12 Hours, he is not so much elevated as under the Pole; so that he
is not 9 of the whole 24, higher than 'tis there, and is 15 Hours lower.
Now the simple Action of the Sun is, as all other Impulses or Stroaks, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
or less forceable, according to the <i>Sinus</i> of the Angle of
Incidence, or to the Perpendicular let fall on the Plain, whence the
vertical Ray (being that of the greatest Heat,) being put <i>Radius</i>,
the force of the Sun on the Horizontal Surface of the Earth will be to
that, as the <i>Sinus</i> of the Sun's Altitude at any other time. This
being allow'd for true, it will then follow, that the time of the
continuance of the Sun's shining being taken for a <i>Basis</i>, and the
<i>Sines</i> of the Sun's Altitudes erected thereon as Perpendiculars,
and a Curve drawn through the Extremities of those Perpendiculars, the
<i>Area</i> comprehended shall be proportionate to the Collection of the
Heat of all the Beams of the Sun in that space of time. Hence it will
follow, that under the Pole the Collection of all the Heat of a tropical
Day, is proportionate to a Rectangle of the <i>Sine</i> of 23½
<i>gr.</i> into 24 Hours, or the Circumference of a Circle; that is, the
<i>Sine</i> of 23½ <i>gr.</i> being nearly 4 Tenths of <i>Radius</i>; as
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> into 12 Hours. Or the Polar Heat is
equal to that of the Sun containing 12 Hours above the Horizon, at 53
<i>gr.</i> height, than which the Sun is not 5 Hours more elevated under
the Æquinoctial.</p>

<p>But that this Matter may the better be understood, I have exemplified
it by a Scheme, (<i>Tab. 4. Fig. 2</i>) wherein the <i>Area ZGHH</i>, is
equal to the <i>Area</i> of all the <i>Sines</i> of the Sun's Altitude
under the Æquinoctial, erected on the respective Hours from Sun-rise to
the Zenith; and the <i>Area ♋HH♋</i> is in the same proportion to the
Heat of the same 6 Hours under the Pole on the Topical Day; and
<i>⨀HHQ</i>, is proportional to the collected Heat of 12
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
Hours, or half a Day under the Pole, which space <i>⨀HHQ</i>, is visibly
greater than the other <i>Area HZGH</i>, by as much as the <i>Area
HGQ</i> is greater than the <i>Area ZG⨀</i>; which, that it is so, is
visible to sight, by a great excess; and so much in proportion does the
Heat of the 24 Hours Sun-shine under the Pole, exceed that of the 12
Hours under the Æquinoctial: Whence, <i>Cæteris paribus</i>, it is
reasonable to conclude, that were the Sun perpetually under the Tropick,
the Pole would be at least as warm, as it is now under the Line it
self.</p>

<p>But whereas the Nature of Heat is to remain in the Subject, after the
Cause that heated is removed, and particularly in the Air; under the
Æquinoctial, the 12 Hours absence of the Sun does very little still the
Motion impressed by the part Action of his Rays, wherein Heat consists,
before he arise again: But under the Pole the long absence of the Sun
for 6 Months, wherein the extremity of Cold does obtain, has so chill'd
the Air, that it is as it were frozen, and cannot, before the Sun has
got far towards it, be any way sensible of his presence, his Beams being
obstructed by thick Clouds, and perpetual Fogs and Mists, and by that
Atmosphere of Cold, as the late Honourable Mr. <i>Boyle</i> was pleased
to term it, proceeding from the everlasting Ice, which in immense
Quantities does chill the Neighbouring Air, and which the too soon
retreat of the Sun leaves unthawed, to encrease again, during the long
Winter that follows this short interval of Summer. But the differing
Degrees of Heat and Cold, in differing Places, depend in great measure
upon the Accidents of the Neighbourhood of high Mountains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
whose height exceedingly chills the Air brought by the Winds over them;
and of the Nature of the Soil, which variously retains the Heat,
particularly the Sandy, which in <i>Africa</i>, <i>Arabia</i>, and
generally where such Sandy Desarts are found, do make the Heat of the
Summer incredible to those that have not felt it.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of this first Thought, I have solved the Problem
generally, <i>viz.</i> to give the proportional Degree of Heat, or the
Sum of all the <i>Sines</i> of the Sun's Altitude, while he is above the
Horizon in any oblique Sphere, by reducing it to the finding of the
Curve Surface of a Cylindrick Hoof, or of a given part thereof.</p>

<p>Now this Problem is not of that difficulty as appears at first sight,
for in <i>Tab. 4. Fig. 3.</i> let the Cylinder ABCD be cut obliquely
with the Ellipse BKDI, and by the Center thereof H, describe the Circle
IKLM; I say, the Curve Surface IKLB is equal to the Rectangle of IK and
BL, or of HK and 2 BL or BC: And if there be supposed another Circle, as
NQPO, cutting the said Ellipse in the Points P, Q; draw PS, QR, parallel
to the Cylinders Axe, till they meet with the aforesaid Circle IKLM in
the Points R, S, and draw the Lines RTS, QVP bisected in T and V. I say
again, that the Curve Surface RMSQDP is equal to the Rectangle of BL or
MD and RS, or of 2 BL or AD and ST or VP; and the Curve Surface QNPD is
equal to RS × MD----the Arch RMS × SP, or the Arch MS × 2 SP: Or it is
equal to the Surface RMSQDP, substracting the Surface RMSQNP. So
likewise the Curve Surface QBPO is equal to the Sum of the Surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
RMSQDP, or RS × MD, and of the Surface RLSQOP, or the Arch LS × 2
SP.</p>

<p>This is the most easily demonstrated from the Consideration, That the
Cylindrick Surface IKLB is to the inscrib'd Spherical Surface IKLE,
either in the whole, or in its Analogous Parts, as the tangent BL is to
the Arch EL, and from the Demonstrations of <i>Archimedes de Sphæra &amp;
Cylindro, Lib. I. Prop.</i> <small>XXX</small>, and
<small>XXXVII</small>, <small>XXXIIX</small>. which I shall not repeat
here, but leave the Reader the pleasure of examining it himself; nor
will it be amiss to consult Dr. <i>Barrow</i>'s Learned Lectures on that
Book, Publish'd at <i>London</i>, <i>Anno 1684</i>, <i>viz.</i>
<i>Probl.</i> <small>IX</small>. and the Corollaries thereof.</p>

<p>Now to reduce our Case of the Sum of all the <i>Sines</i> of the
Sun's Altitude in a given Declination and Latitude to the aforesaid
Problem, let us consider (<i>Tab. 4. Fig. 4.</i>) which is the
<i>Analemma</i> projected on the Plain of the <i>Meridian</i>, Z the
Zenith, P the Pole, HH the Horizon, ææ the Æquinoctial, ♋♋, ♑♑ the two
Tropicks, ♋1 the <i>Sine</i> of the Meridian Altitude in ♋; and equal
thereto, but perpendicular to the Tropick, erect ♋I, and draw the Line
TI intersecting the Horizon in T, and the Hour Circle of 6, in the Point
4, and 64 shall be equal to 6R, or to the Sine of the Altitude at 6: And
the like for any other Point in the Tropick, erecting a Perpendicular
thereat, terminated by the Line T I: Through the Point 4 draw the Line
4, 5, 7 parallel to the Tropick, and representing a Circle equal
thereto; then shall the Tropick ♋♋ in <i>Fig. 4.</i> answer to the
Circle NOPQ, in <i>Fig. 3.</i> the Circle 457 shall answer the Circle
IKLM, T4I shall answer to the Elliptick Segment QIBKP, 6R or 64 shall
answer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
SP, and 5I to BL, and the Arch ♋T, to the Arch LS, being the semidiurnal
Arch in that Latitude and Declination; the <i>Sine</i> whereof, tho' not
expressible in <i>Fig. 4.</i> must be conceived as Analogous to the Line
TS or UP in <i>Fig. 3.</i></p>

<p>The Relation between these two Figures being well understood, it will
follow from what precedes, That, <i>the sum of the
<strong>Sines</strong> of the Meridian Altitudes of the Sun in the two
Tropicks, (and the like for any two opposite Parallels) being multiplied
by the <strong>Sine</strong> of the semidiurnal Arch, will give an
<strong>Area</strong> Analogous to the Curve Surface RIMSQDP; and
thereto adding in Summer, or substracting in Winter, the Product of the
length of the semidiurnal Arch, (taken according to <strong>Van
Ceulen</strong>'s Numbers) into the difference of the above-said
<strong>Sines</strong> of the Meridian Altitude: The sum in one case,
and difference in another, shall be as the Aggregate of all the
<strong>Sines</strong> of the Sun's Altitude, during his appearance
above the Horizon; and consequently of all his Heat and Action on the
Plain of the Horizon in the proposed Day</i>. And this may also be
extended to the parts of the same Day; for if the aforesaid Sum of the
<i>Sines</i> of the Meridian Altitudes, be multiplied by half the Sum of
the <i>Sines</i> of the Sun's Horary distance from Noon, when the Times
are before and after Noon; or by half their difference, when both are on
the same side of the Meridian; and thereto in Summer, or therefrom in
Winter, be added or substracted the Product of half the Arch answerable
to the proposed interval of Time, into the difference of the
<i>Sines</i> of Meridian Altitudes, the Sum in one case and Difference
in the other, shall be proportional to all the Action of the Sun during
that space of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
I fore-see it will be Objected, that I take the <i>Radius</i> of my
Circle on which I erect my Perpendiculars always the same, whereas the
Parallels of Declination are unequal; but to this I answer, That our
said Circular Bases ought not to be Analogous to the Parallels, but to
the Times of Revolution, which are equal in all of them.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be useful to give an Example of the Computation of
this Rule, which may seem difficult to some. Let the Solstitical Heat in
♋ and ♑ be required at <i>London</i>, <i>Lat.</i> 51° 32'.</p>

<p>Those that desire more of the Nature of this Problem, as to the
Geometry thereof, would do well to compare the XIII. <i>Prop. Cap.
V.</i> of the Learned Treatise, <i>De Calculo Centri Gravitatis</i>, by
the Reverend Dr. <i>Wallis</i>, Published <i>Anno 1670</i>.</p>

<p>From this Rule there follow several Corollaries worth Note: As
I. That the Æquinoctial Heat, when the Sun comes Vertical, is as twice
the Square of <i>Radius</i>, which may be proposed as a Standard to
compare with, in all other Cases. II. That under the Æquinoctial, the
Heat is as the <i>Sine</i> of the Sun's Declination. III. That in the
Frigid Zones when the Sun sets not, the Heat is as the Circumference of
a Circle into the <i>Sine</i> of the Altitude at 6. And consequently,
that in the same Latitude these Aggregates of Warmth, are as the
<i>Sines</i> of the Sun's Declinations; and in the same Declination of
<i>Sol</i>, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
are as the <i>Sines</i> of the Latitude, and generally they are as the
<i>Sines</i> of the Latitude into the <i>Sines</i> of Declination.
IV. That the Æquinoctial Days Heat is every where as the Co-sine of the
Latitude. V. In all places where the Sun sets, the difference between
the Summer and Winter Heats, when the Declinations are contrary, is
equal to a Circle into the <i>Sine</i> of the Altitude at six in the
Summer Parallel, and consequently those differences are as the
<i>Sines</i> of Latitude into, or multiplied by the <i>Sines</i> of
Declination. VI. From the Table I have added, it appears, that the
Tropical Sun under the Æquinoctial, has, of all others, the least Force.
Under the Pole it is greater than any other Days Heat whatsoever, being
to that of the Æquinoctial as 5 to 4.</p>

<p>From the Table and these Corollaries may a general <i>Idea</i> be
conceived of the Sum of all the Actions of the Sun in the whole Year,
and that part of the Heat that arises simply from the Presence of the
Sun be brought to a Geometrical Certainty: And if the like could be
performed for Cold; which is something else than the bare Absence of the
Sun, as appears by many Instances, we might hope to bring what relates
to this part of <i>Meteorology</i> to a perfect Theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span></p>

<h3>Concerning the Distance of the Fix'd Stars. By the Honourable
<strong>Francis Roberts</strong>, Esq; S. R. S.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE Ancient Astronomers, who had no other way of
computing the Distances of the Heavenly Bodies, but by their Parallax to
the Semi-diameter of the Earth; and being never able to discover any in
the fix'd Stars, did from thence rightly enough infer, that their
Distance was very great, and much exceeding that of the Planets, but
could go no farther otherwise than by uncertain guess.</p>

<p>Since the <i>Pythagorean</i> System of the World has been reviv'd by
<i>Copernicus</i>, (and now by all Mathematicians accepted for the true
one) there seem'd Ground to imagine that the Diameter of the Earth's
Annual Course (which, according to our best Astronomers, is at least
40000 times bigger than the Semi-diameter of the Earth) might give a
sensible Parallax to the fix'd Stars, though the other could not, and
thereby determine their Distance more precisely.</p>

<p>But though we have a Foundation to build on so vastly exceeding that
of the Ancients, there are some Considerations may make us suspect that
even this is not large enough for our purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
Monsieur <i>Hugens</i> (who is very exact in his Astronomical
Observations) tells us, he could never discover any visible Magnitude in
the fix'd Stars, though he used Glasses which magnified the apparent
Diameter above 100 times.</p>

<p>Now, since in all likelyhood the fix'd Stars are Suns, (perhaps of a
different Magnitude) we may as a reasonable <i>Medium</i> presume they
are generally about the bigness of the Sun.</p>

<p>Let us then (for Example) suppose the Dog-Star to be so. The Distance
from us to the Sun being about 100 times the Sun's Diameter (as is
demonstrable from the Sun's Diameter being 32 Minutes) it is evident,
that the Angle under which the Dog-Star is seen in Mr. <i>Hugens</i>'s
Telescope, must be near the same with the Angle of its Parallax to the
Sun's Distance, or Semi-diameter of the Earth's Annual Course; so that
the Parallax to the whole Diameter, can be but double such a quantity,
as even to Mr. <i>Hugens</i>'s nice Observation is altogether
insensible.</p>

<p>The Distance therefore of the fix'd Stars seems hardly within the
reach of any of our Methods to determine; but from what has been laid
down, we may draw some Conclusions that will much illustrate the
prodigious vastness of it.</p>

<p>1. That the Diameter of the Earth's Annual Orb (which contains at
least 160 Millions of Miles) is but as a Point in comparison of it; at
least it must be above 6000 times the Distance of the Sun. For if a Star
should appear thro' the aforesaid Telescope half a Minute broad (which
is a pretty sensible Magnitude) the true apparent Diameter would not
exceed 18 3d Minutes, which is less than the 6000th part of the apparent
Diameter of the Sun, and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
the Sun's Distance not the 6000th part of the Distance of the Star.</p>

<p>2. That could we advance towards the Stars 99 Parts of the whole
Distance, and have only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> Part
remaining, the Stars would appear little bigger to us than they do here;
for they would shew no otherwise than they do through a Telescope, which
magnifies an Hundred-fold.</p>

<p>3. That at least Nine Parts in Ten of the Space between us and the
fix'd Stars, can receive no greater Light from the Sun, or any of the
Stars, than what we have from the Stars in a clear Night.</p>

<p>4. That Light takes up more time in travelling from the Stars to us,
than we in making a <i>West-India</i> Voyage (which is ordinarily
perform'd in six Weeks.) That a Sound would not arrive to us from thence
in 50000 Years, nor a Cannon-bullet in a much longer time. This is
easily computed, by allowing (according to Mr. <i>Newton</i>) Ten
Minutes for the Journey of Light from the Sun hither, and that a Sound
moves about 1300 Foot in a Second.</p>

<h3>The Famous Mr. <strong>Isaac Newton</strong>'s Theory of the
<strong>Moon</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THIS <i>Theory</i> which hath been long expected by
all the true Lovers of <i>Astronomy</i>, was communicated from Mr.
<i>Newton</i> to Dr. <i>Gregory</i>, <i>Astronomy</i> Professor at
<i>Oxford</i>, and by him published in his <i>Astron. Elem. Philos.</i>
and <i>Geomet.</i> p. 336. From whence, as it was lately translated into
<i>English</i>, I thought fit to insert it here.</p>

<p>By this Theory, what by all Astronomers was thought most difficult
and almost impossible to be done, the Excellent Mr. <i>Newton</i> hath
now effected; <i>viz.</i> to determine the Moon's Place even in her
Quadratures, and all other Parts of her Orbit, besides the Syzygys, so
accurately by Calculation, that the Difference between that and her true
Place in the Heavens, shall scarce be above two minutes in her Syzygys,
or above three in her Quadratures, and is usually so small, that it may
well enough be reckon'd only as a Defect in the Observation. And this
Mr. <i>Newton</i> experienced, by comparing it with very many Places of
the Moon, observ'd by Mr. <i>Flamsteed</i>, and communicated to him.</p>

<p>The Royal Observatory at <i>Greenwich</i>, is to the West of the
Meridian of <i>Paris</i>, 2 degrees, 19 minutes. Of <i>Uraniburgh</i>,
12 degrees, 51 minutes, 30 seconds. And of <i>Gedanum</i>, 18 degrees,
48 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
The mean Motions of the Sun and Moon, accounted from the Vernal Æquinox
at the Meridian of <i>Greenwich</i>, I make to be as followeth.</p>

<p>The last Day of <i>December 1680</i>, at Noon (<i>Old Stile</i>) the
mean Motion of the Sun was 9 Signs, 20 degrees, 34 minutes, 46 seconds.
Of the Sun's Apogæum, was 3 S. 7 deg. 23 min. 30 seconds.</p>

<p>That the mean Motion of the Moon at that time, was 6 S. 1 degree, 45
minutes, 45 seconds. And of her Apogee, 8 S. 4 degrees, 28 minutes, 5
seconds. Of the ascending Node of the Moon's Orbit, 5 S. 24 deg. 14 min.
35 seconds, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>And on the last Day of <i>December, 1700</i>, at Noon, the mean
Motion of the Sun was 9 S. 20 degrees, 43 minutes, 50 seconds. Of the
Sun's Apogee, 3 S. 7 degrees, 44 minutes, 30 seconds. The mean Motion of
the Moon was 10 S. 15 degrees, 19 minutes, 50 seconds. Of the Moon's
Apogee, 11 S. 8 degrees, 18 minutes, 20 seconds. And of her ascending
Node, 4 S. 27 degrees, 24 minutes, 20 seconds. For in 20 <i>Julian</i>
Years, or 7305 Days, the Sun's Motion is 20 Revol. 0 S. 0 degrees, 9
minutes, 4 seconds. And the Motion of the Sun's Apogee, 21 minutes, 0
seconds.</p>

<p>The Motion of the Moon in the same time, is 267 Revol. 4 S. 13
degrees, 34 minutes, 5 seconds. And the Motion of the Lunar Apogee, is 2
Revol. 3 S. 3 degrees, 50 minutes, 15 seconds. And the Motion of her
Node, 1 Revol. 0 S, 26 degrees, 50 minutes, 15 seconds.</p>

<p>All which Motions are accounted from the Vernal Æquinox: Wherefore if
from them there be subtracted the Recession or Motion of the Æquinoctial
Point, in <i>Antecedentia</i>, during that space, which is 16 minutes,
40 seconds, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
will remain the Motions in reference to the fix'd Stars in 20
<i>Julian</i> Years; <i>viz.</i> the Sun's 19 Revol. 11 S. 29 degrees,
52 minutes, 24 seconds. Of his Apogee, 4 minutes, 20 seconds. And the
Moon's 267 Revol. 4 S. 13 degrees, 17 minutes, 25 seconds. Of her
Apogee, 2 Revol. 3 S. 3 degrees, 33 minutes, 35 seconds. And of the Node
of the Moon, 1 Revol. 0 S. 27 degrees, 6 minutes, 55 seconds.</p>

<p>According to this Computation, the <i>Tropical Year</i> is 365 Days,
5 Hours, 48 Minutes, 57 Seconds. And the <i>Sydereal Year</i> is 365
Days, 6 Hours, 9 Minutes, 14 Seconds.</p>

<p>These mean Motions of the Luminaries are affected with various
Inequalities: Of which,</p>

<p>1. There are the Annual Equations of the aforesaid mean Motions of
the Sun and Moon, and of the Apogee and Node of the Moon.</p>

<p>The Annual Equation of the mean Motion of the Sun, depends on the
Eccentricity of the Earth's Orbit round the Sun, which is
16<sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>12</sub> of such Parts, as that the Earth's
mean Distance from the Sun shall be 1000: Whence 'tis call'd the
<i>Equation of the Centre</i>; and is, when greatest, 1 degree, 56
minutes, 20 seconds.</p>

<p>The greatest Annual Equation of the Moon's mean Motion, is 11
degrees, 49 seconds; of her Apogee, 20 minutes, and of her Node, 9
minutes, 30 seconds.</p>

<p>And these four Annual Equations are always mutually proportional one
to another: Wherefore when any of them is at the greatest, the other
three will also be greatest; and when any one lessens, the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
three will also be diminished in the same
Ratio.</p>

<p>The Annual Equation of the Sun's Centre being given, the three other
corresponding Annual Equations will be also given; and therefore a Table
of that will serve for all. For if the Annual Equation of the Sun's
Centre be taken from thence, for any Time, and be call'd P, and let ⅒P =
Q, Q + <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>60</sub>Q = R, ⅙P = D, D +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub>D = E, and D -
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>D = 2F; then shall the Annual Equation
of the Moon's mean Motion for that time be R, that of the Apogee of the
Moon will be E, and that of the Node F.</p>

<p>Only observe here, That if the Equation of the Sun's Centre be
required to be added; then the Equation of the Moon's mean Motion must
be subtracted, that of her Apogee must be added, and that of the Node
subducted, And on the contrary, if the Equation of the Sun's Centre were
to be subducted, the Moon's Equation must be added, the Equation of her
Apogee subducted, and that of her Node added.</p>

<p>There is also an <i>Equation of the Moon's mean Motion</i>, depending
on the situation of her Apogee, in respect of the Sun; which is greatest
when the Moon's Apogee is in an Octant with the Sun, and is nothing at
all when it is in the Quadratures or Syzygys. This Equation, when
greatest, and the Sun in <i>Perigæo</i>, is 3 Minutes, 56 Seconds. But
if the Sun be in <i>Apogæo</i>, it will never be above 3 Minutes, 34
Seconds. At other Distances of the Sun from the Earth, this Equation,
when greatest, is reciprocally as the Cube of such Distance. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
when the Moon's Apogee is any where but in the <i>Octants</i>, this
Equation grows less, and is mostly at the same distance between the
Earth and Sun, as the Sine of the double Distance of the Moon's Apogee,
from the next Quadrature or Syzygy, to the Radius.</p>

<p>This is to be added to the Moon's Motion, while her Apogee passes
from a Quadrature with the Sun to a Syzygy; but this is to be subtracted
from it, while the Apogee moves from the Syzygy to the Quadrature.</p>

<p>There is moreover another <i>Equation of the Moon's Motion</i>, which
depends on the Aspect of the Nodes of the Moon's Orbit with the Sun: And
this is greatest, when her Nodes are in <i>Octants</i> to the Sun, and
vanishes quite, when they come to their Quadratures or Syzygys. This
Equation is proportional to the Sine of the double Distance of the Node
from the next Syzygy, or Quadrature; and at greatest, is but 47 seconds.
This must be added to the Moon's mean Motion, while the Nodes are
passing from their Syzygys with the Sun, to their Quadratures with him;
but subtracted while they pass from the Quadratures to the Syzygys.</p>

<p>From the Sun's true Place, take the equated mean Motion of the Lunar
Apogee, as was above shew'd, the Remainder will be the Annual Argument
of the said Apogee. From whence the <i>Eccentricity of the Moon</i>, and
the <i>second Equation</i> of her Apogee may be computed after the
manner of the following (<i>which takes place also in the Computation of
any other intermediate Equations</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
Tab. 3. Fig. 6. Let T represent the Earth, TS, a Right Line joining the
Earth and Sun, TACB, a Right Line drawn from the Earth to the middle or
mean Place of the Moon's Apogee, equated, as above: Let the Angle STA be
the Annual Argument of the aforesaid Apogee, TA the least Eccentricity
of the Moon's Orbit, TB the greatest. Bissect AB in G; and on the Centre
C, with the Distance AC describe a Circle AFB, and make the Angle BCF =
to the double of the Annual Argument. Draw the Right Line TF, that shall
be the Eccentricity of the Moon's Orbit; and the Angle BTF, is the
second Equation of the Moon's Apogee required.</p>

<p>In order to whose Determination, let the mean Distance of the Earth
from the Moon, or the Semi-diameter of the Moon's Orbit, be 100000; then
shall its greatest Eccentricity TB be 66782 such Parts; and the least
TA, 43319. So that the greatest Equation of the Orbit, <i>viz.</i> when
the Apogee is in the Syzygys, will be 7 degrees, 39 minutes, 30 seconds,
or perhaps 7 degrees, 40 minutes, (for I suspect there will be some
Alteration, according to the Position of the Apogee in <i>Cancer</i> and
<i>Capricorn</i>.) But when it is Quadrate to the Sun, the greatest
Equation aforesaid will be 4 degrees, 57 minutes, 56 seconds; and the
greatest Equation of the Apogee, 12 degrees, 15 minutes, 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Having from these Principles made a Table of the Equation of the
Moon's Apogee, and of the Eccentricities of her Orbit to each degree of
the Annual Argument, from whence the Eccentricity TF, and the Angle BTF
(<i>viz.</i> the second and the principal Equation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
the Apogee) may easily be had for any Time required; let the Equation
thus found be added to the first Equated Place of the Moon's Apogee, if
the Annual Argument be less than 90 degrees, or greater than 180
degrees, and less than 270; otherwise it must be subducted from it; and
the Sum or Difference shall be the Place of the Lunar Apogee secondarily
equated; which being taken from the Moon's Place equated a third time,
shall leave the mean Anomaly of the Moon corresponding to any given
Time. Moreover, from this mean Anomaly of the Moon, and the before-found
Eccentricity of her Orbit, may be found (by means of a Table of
Equations of the Moon's Centre made to every degree of the mean Anomaly,
and some Eccentricities, <i>viz.</i> 45000, 50000, 55000, 60000, and
65000) the <i>Prostaphæresis</i>, or Equation of the Moon's Centre, as
in the common way: And this being taken from the former Semi-circle of
the middle Anomaly, and added in the latter to the Moon's Place thus
thrice equated, will produce the Place of the Moon a fourth time
equated.</p>

<p>The greatest Variation of the Moon (<i>viz.</i> that which happens
when the Moon is in an Octant with the Sun) is nearly, reciprocally as
the Cube of the Distance of the Sun from the Earth. Let that be taken 37
minutes, 25 seconds, when the Sun is <i>in Perigæo</i>, and 33 minutes,
40 seconds, when he is <i>in Apogæo</i>: And let the Differences of this
Variation in the Octants be made reciprocally, as the Cubes of the
Distances of the Sun from the Earth; and so let a Table be made of the
aforesaid Variation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
of the Moon in her Octants (or its Logarithms) to every Tenth, Sixth, or
Fifth Degree of the mean Anomaly: And for the Variation out of the
Octants, make, as Radius to the Sine of the double Distance of the Moon
from the next Syzygy, or Quadrature :: so let the afore-found Variation
in the Octant be to the Variation congruous to any other Aspect; and
this added to the Moon's Place before found in the first and third
Quadrant (accounting from the Sun) or subducted from it in the second
and fourth, will give the Moon's Place equated a fifth time.</p>

<p>Again, as Radius to the Sine of the Summ of the Distances of the Moon
from the Sun, and of her Apogee from the Sun's Apogee (or the Sine of
the Excess of that Summ above 360 degrees,) :: so is 2 minutes, 10
seconds, to a sixth Equation of the Moon's Place, which must be
subtracted, if the aforesaid Summ or Excess be less than a Semi-circle;
but added, if it be greater. Let it be made also, as Radius to the Sine
of the Moon's distance from the Sun :: so 2 degrees, 20 secants, to a
seventh Equation; which when the Moon's Light is increasing, add; but
when decreasing, subtract; and the Moon's Place will be equated a
seventh time, and this is her Place <i>in her proper Orbit</i>.</p>

<p>Note here, the Equation thus produced by the mean Quantity 2 degrees,
20 seconds, is not always of the same magnitude; but is increased and
diminished, according to the Position of the Lunar Apogee. For if the
Moon's Apogee be in Conjunction with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
Sun's, the aforesaid Equation is about 54 seconds greater: But when the
Apogees are in Opposition, 'tis about as much less; and it librates
between its greatest Quantity 3 minutes, 14 seconds, and its least, 1
minute, 26 seconds. And this is, when the Lunar Apogee is in
Conjunction, or Opposition with the Sun's: But in the Quadratures, the
aforesaid Equation is to be lessen'd about 50 seconds, or 1 minute, when
the Apogees of the Sun and Moon are in Conjunction; but if they are in
Opposition, for want of a sufficient number of Observations, I cannot
determine, whether it is to be lessen'd or increas'd. And even as to the
Argument or Decrement of the Equation, 2 minutes, 20 seconds, above
mentioned, I dare determine nothing certain, for the same Reason,
<i>viz.</i> the want of Observations accurately made.</p>

<p>If the sixth and seventh Equations are augmented or diminished in a
reciprocal <i>Ratio</i> of the distance of the Moon from the Earth;
<i>i. e.</i> in a direct <i>Ratio</i> of the Moon's Horizontal Parallax,
they will become more accurate: And this may be readily done, if Tables
are first made to each minute of the said Parallax, and to every sixth
or fifth degree of the Argument of the sixth Equation for the Sixth, as
of the distance of the Moon from the Sun, for the Seventh Equation.</p>

<p>From the Sun's Place, take the mean motion of the Moon's ascending
Node, equated as above; the Remainder shall be the Annual Argument of
the Node, whence its second Equation may be computed after the following
manner in the preceding Figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
Let T, as before, represent the Earth; TS a Right Line, conjoining the
Earth and Sun: Let also the Line TACB, be drawn to the Place of the
ascending Node of the Moon, as above equated; and let STA be the Annual
Argument of the Node. Take TA from a Scale, and let it be to AB :: as 56
to 3, or as 11⅔ to 1. Then bissect BA in C, and on C as a Centre, with
the Distance CA, describe a Circle, as AFB, and make the Angle BCF,
equal to double the Annual Argument of the Node before-found: So shall
the Angle BTF, be the second Equation of the ascending Node; which must
be added, when the Node is passing from the Quadrature to a Syzygy with
the Sun; and subducted, when the Node moves from a Syzygy towards a
Quadrature. By which means, the true Place of the Node of the Lunar
Orbit will be gained: Whence from Tables made after the common way, the
<i>Moon's Latitude, and the Reduction of her Orbit to the Ecliptick</i>,
may be computed, supposing the Inclination of the Moon's Orbit to the
Ecliptick, to be 4 degrees, 59 minutes, 35 seconds, when the Nodes are
in Quadrature with the Sun; and 5 degrees, 17 minutes, 20 seconds, when
they are in the Syzygys.</p>

<p>And from the Longitude and Latitude thus found, and the given
Obliquity of the Ecliptick, 23 degrees, 29 minutes, the Right Ascension
and Declination of the Moon will be found.</p>

<p>The Horizontal Parallax of the Moon, when she is in the Syzygys, at a
mean distance from the Earth, I make to be 57 minutes, 30 seconds; and
her Horary Motion, 33 minutes, 32
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
seconds, 32 thirds; and her apparent Diameter 31 minutes, 30 seconds.
But in her Quadratures at a mean Distance from the Earth, I make the
Horizontal Parallax of the Moon to be 59 minutes, 40 seconds, her Horary
Motion 32 minutes, 12 seconds, 2 thirds, and her apparent Diameter, 31
minutes, 3 seconds. The Moon in an Octant to the Sun, and at a mean
distance, hath her Centre distant from the Centre of the Earth about
60<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> of the Earth's Semi-diameters.</p>

<p>The Sun's Horizontal Parallax I make to be 10 seconds, and its
apparent Diameter at a mean distance from the Earth, I make 32 minutes,
15 seconds.</p>

<p>The Atmosphere of the Earth, by dispersing and refracting the Sun's
Light, casts a Shadow, as if it were an Opake Body, at least to the
height of 40 or 50 Geographical Miles (by a Geographical Mile, I mean
the sixtieth part of a Degree of a great Circle, on the Earth's
Surface.) This Shadow falling upon the Moon in a Lunar Eclipse, makes
the Earth's Shadow be the larger or broader. And to each Mile of the
Earth's Atmosphere, is correspondent a Second in the Moon's Disk, so
that the Semi-diameter of the Earth's shadow projected upon the Disk of
the Moon, is to be increased about 50 seconds: Or, which is all one, in
a Lunar Eclipse, the Horizontal Parallax of the Moon is to be increased
in the Ratio of about 70 to 69.</p>

<p>Thus far the Theory of this Incomparable Mathematician. And if we had
many Places of the Moon accurately observ'd, especially about her
Quadratures, and these well compar'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
with her Places, at the same time calculated according to this Theory;
it would then appear, whether there yet remain any other sensible
Equations; which when accounted for, might serve to improve and enlarge
this Theory.</p>

<h3>An Estimate of the Degrees of the <strong>Mortality</strong> of
Mankind, drawn from curious <strong>Tables</strong> of the
<strong>Births</strong> and <strong>Funerals</strong> at the City of
<strong>Breslaw</strong>; with an Attempt to ascertain the Price of
<strong>Annuities</strong> upon <strong>Lives</strong>. By Mr.
<strong>E. Halley</strong>, R. S. S.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE Contemplation of the <i>Mortality</i> of
<i>Mankind</i>, has besides the <i>Moral</i>, its <i>Physical</i> and
<i>Political</i> Uses, both which have been some Years since most
judiciously consider'd by the Curious Sir <i>William Petty</i>, in his
<i>Natural</i> and <i>Political</i> Observations on the Bills of
<i>Mortality</i> of <i>London</i>, own'd by Captain <i>John Graunt</i>:
And since in a like Treatise on the Bills of <i>Mortality</i> of
<i>Dublin</i>. But the Deduction from those Bills of <i>Mortality</i>
seemed even to their Authors to be defective: First, In that the
<i>Number</i> of the People was wanting. Secondly, That the <i>Ages</i>
of the People dying was not to be had. And Lastly, That both
<i>London</i> and <i>Dublin</i>, by reason of the great and casual
Accession of <i>Strangers</i> who die therein, (as appeared in both, by
the great Excess of the <i>Funerals</i> above the <i>Births</i>) rendred
them incapable of being Standards for this purpose; which requires, if
it were possible, that the People we treat of, should not at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
be changed, but die where they were born, without any adventitious
Increase from Abroad, or Decay by Migration elsewhere.</p>

<p>This <i>Defect</i> seems in a great measure to be satisfied by the
late curious Tables of the Bills of <i>Mortality</i> at the City of
<i>Breslaw</i>, lately communicated to this Honourable Society by Mr.
<i>Justell</i>, wherein both the Ages and Sexes of all that die, are
Monthly delivered, and compared with the number of the <i>Births</i>,
for Five Years last past, <i>viz.</i> 1687, 88, 89, 90, 91, seeming to
be done with all the Exactness and Sincerity possible.</p>

<p>This City of <i>Breslaw</i> is the Capital City of the Province of
<i>Silesia</i>; or, as the <i>Germans</i> call it, <i>Schlesia</i>, and
is situated on the Western Bank of the River <i>Oder</i>, anciently
call'd <i>Viadrus</i>, near the Confines of <i>Germany</i> and
<i>Poland</i>, and very nigh the Latitude of <i>London</i>. It is very
far from the Sea, and as much a <i>Mediterranean</i> Place as can be
desired, whence the Confluence of Strangers is but small, and the
Manufacture of Linnen employs chiefly the poor People of the Place, as
well as of the Country round about; whence comes that sort of Linnen we
usually call your <i>Sclesiæ Linnen</i>; which is the chief, if not the
only Merchandize of the Place. For these Reasons, the People of this
City seem most proper for a <i>Standard</i>; and the rather, for that
the <i>Births</i> do a small matter exceed the Funerals. The only thing
wanting, is the Number of the whole People, which in some measure I have
endeavour'd to supply, by the comparison of the <i>Mortality</i> of the
People of all Ages, which I shall from the said Bills trace out with all
the Accuracy possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282"
id="Page_282">{282}</a></span> It appears that in the Five Years
mentioned, <i>viz.</i> from 87 to 91 inclusive, there were born 6193
Persons, and buried 5869; that is, born <i>per Annum</i> 1238, and
buried 1174; whence an <i>Increase</i> of the People may be argued of 64
<i>per Annum</i>, or of about a 20th part, which may perhaps be balanc'd
by the Levies for the <i>Emperor</i>'s Service in his Wars. But this
being contingent, and the Births certain, I will suppose the People of
<i>Breslaw</i> to be increased by 1238 <i>Births</i> annually. Of these
it appears by the same Tables, that 348 do die <i>yearly</i> in the
<i>first Year</i> of their <i>Age</i>, and that but 890 do arrive at a
full <i>Year's Age</i>; and likewise, that 198 do die in the <i>Five
Years</i> between 1 and 6 compleat, taken at a <i>Medium</i>; so that
but 692 of the Persons <i>born</i> do survive <i>Six</i> whole
<i>Years</i>. From this <i>Age</i> the Infants being arrived at some
degree of Firmness, grow less and less <i>Mortal</i>; and it appears,
that of the whole People of <i>Breslaw</i> there die <i>yearly</i>, as
in the following Table, wherein the upper Line shews the <i>Age</i>, and
the next under it, the <i>Number</i> of Persons of that Age <i>dying
yearly</i>.</p>

<p>And where no Figure is placed over, it is to be understood of those
that die between the Ages of the precedent and consequent
<i>Column</i>.</p>

<p>From this Table it is evident, that from the Age of 9 to about 25,
there does not die above 6 <i>per Annum</i> of each Age, which is much
about 1 <i>per Cent.</i> of those that are of those <i>Ages</i>: And
whereas in the 14, 15, 16, 17 <i>Years</i>, there appear to die much
fewer, as 2 and 3½; yet that seems rather to be attributed to Chance, as
are the other Irregularities in the Series of Ages, which would rectifie
themselves, were the number of Years much more considerable, as 20
instead of 5. And by our own Experience in <i>Christ-Church
Hospital</i>, I am inform'd there die of the <i>Young Lads</i>, much
about 1 <i>per Cent. per Annum</i>, they being of the aforesaid
<i>Ages</i>. From 25 to 50, there seem to die from 7 to 8 and 9 <i>per
Annum</i> of each Age; and after that to 70, they growing more
<i>crasie</i>, though the number be much diminished, yet the
<i>Mortality increases</i>, and there are found to die 10 or 11 of each
Age <i>per Annum</i>: From thence the number of the Living being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
grown very small, they gradually decline till there be none left to
<i>die</i>; as may be seen at one View in the Table.</p>

<p>From these Considerations I have form'd the <i>adjoined Table</i>,
whose Uses are manifold, and give a more just <i>Idea</i> of the
<i>State</i> and <i>Condition</i> of <i>Mankind</i>, than any thing yet
extant that I know of. It exhibits the <i>Number</i> of <i>People</i> in
the City of <i>Breslaw</i> of all Ages, from the <i>Birth</i> to extreme
<i>Old Age</i>, and thereby shews the Chances of <i>Mortality</i> at all
<i>Ages</i>, and likewise how to make a certain Estimate of the Value of
<i>Annuities</i> for <i>Lives</i>, which hitherto has been only done by
an imaginary <i>Valuation</i>: Also the <i>Chances</i> that there are
that a <i>Person</i> of any <i>Age</i> proposed does live to any other
<i>Age</i> given; with many more, as I shall hereafter shew. This
<i>Table</i> does shew the <i>Number</i> of Persons that are living in
the <i>Age</i> current annexed thereto, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
Thus it appears, that the whole People of <i>Breslaw</i> does consist of
34000 <i>Souls</i>, being the Sum <i>Total</i> of the Persons of all
Ages in the <i>Table</i>: The first use hereof is to shew the Proportion
of <i>Men</i> able to bear <i>Arms</i> in any <i>Multitude</i>, which
are those between 18 and 56, rather than 16 and 60; the one being
generally too weak to bear the <i>Fatigues</i> of <i>War</i>, and the
Weight of <i>Arms</i>; and the other too crasie and infirm from
<i>Age</i>, notwithstanding particular Instances to the contrary. Under
18 from the <i>Table</i>, are found in this City 11997 Persons, 3950
above 56, which together make 15947, so that the Residue to 34000 being
18053, are Persons between those <i>Ages</i>. At least one half thereof
are Males, or 9027: So that the whole Force this City can raise of
<i>Fencible Men</i>, as the <i>Scotch</i> call them, is about 9000, or
<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>34</sub>, or somewhat more than a quarter of the
<i>Number</i> of <i>Souls</i>; which may parhaps pass for a Rule for all
other places.</p>

<p>The <i>Second Use</i> of this <i>Table</i>, is, to shew the differing
degrees of <i>Mortality</i>, or rather <i>Vitality</i>, in all
<i>Ages</i>; for if the Number of Persons of any <i>Age</i> remaining
after one Year, be divided by the difference between that and the number
of the <i>Age</i> proposed, it shews the <i>Odds</i> that there is, that
a Person of that <i>Age</i> does not die in a <i>Year</i>. As for
Instance, a Person of 25 <i>Years</i> of <i>Age</i> has the Odds of 560
to 7, or 80 to 1, that he does not <i>die</i> in a <i>Year</i>: Because
that of 567, living of 25 <i>Years</i> of <i>Age</i>, there do die no
more than 7 in a <i>Year</i>, leaving 560 of 26 Years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
So likewise for the <i>Odds</i>, that any Person does not die before he
attain any proposed <i>Age</i>: Take the <i>number</i> of the remaining
Persons of the <i>Age</i> proposed, and divide it by the difference
between it and the number of those of the <i>Age</i> of the Party
proposed; and that shews the <i>Odds</i> there is between the Chances of
the Party's living or dying. As for Instance; What is the <i>Odds</i>
that a Man of 40 lives 7 Years: Take the number of Persons of 47 Years,
which in the Table is 377, and subtract it from the number of Persons of
40 Years, which is 445, and the <i>difference</i> is 68: Which shews
that the <i>Persons dying</i> in that 7 Years, are 68, and that it is
377 to 68, or 5½ to 1, that a Man of 40 does live 7 Years. And the like
for any other <i>number</i> of <i>Years</i>.</p>

<p><i>Use</i> III. But if it be enquired at what number of <i>Years</i>, it
is an even Lay that a Person of any <i>Age</i> shall die, this Table
readily performs it; For if the <i>number</i> of Persons <i>living</i>
of the <i>Age</i> proposed, be <i>halfed</i>, it will be found by the
<i>Table</i> at what Year the said <i>Number</i> is reduced to half by
<i>Mortality</i>; and that is the <i>Age</i>, to which it is an even
Wager, that a Person of the <i>Age</i> proposed shall arrive before he
<i>die</i>. As for Instance; A Person of 30 Years of <i>Age</i> is
proposed, the number of that <i>Age</i> is 531, the half thereof is 265,
which number I find to be between 57 and 58 Years; so that a Man of 30
may reasonably expect to live between 27 and 28 Years.</p>

<p><i>Use</i> IV. By what has been said, the <i>Price</i> of
<i>Insurance</i> upon Lives ought to be regulated, and the difference is
discovered between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
<i>Price</i> of insuring the <i>Life</i> of a <i>Man</i> of 20 and 50.
For Example; It being 100 to 1, that a Man of 20 dies not in a Year, and
but 38 to 1, for a Man of 50 Years of Age.</p>

<p><i>Use</i> V. On this depends the Valuation of <i>Annuities</i> upon
<i>Lives</i>; for it is plain, that the <i>Purchaser</i> ought to pay
for only such a part of the Value of the <i>Annuity</i>, as he has
Chances that he is living; and this ought to be computed yearly, and the
Sum of all those yearly Values being added together, will amount to the
Value of the <i>Annuity</i> for the <i>Life</i> of the Person proposed.
Now the present Value of Money payable after a Term of Years, at any
given Rate of Interest, either may be had from Tables already computed;
or almost as compendiously, by the Table of Logarithms: For the
Arithmetical Complement of the Logarithm of Unity, and its yearly
Interest, (that is, of 1,06 for Six <i>per Cent.</i> being 9,974694.)
being multiplied by the number of Years proposed, gives the present
Value of One Pound payable after the end of so many Years. Then by the
foregoing Proposition, it will be as the number of Persons living after
that Term of Years, to the number dead; so are the Odds that any one
Person is alive or dead. And by consequence, as the Sum of both, or the
number of Persons living of the <i>Age</i> first proposed, to the number
remaining after so many Years, (both given by the Table) so the present
Value of the yearly Sum payable after the Term proposed, to the Sum
which ought to be paid for the Chance the Person has to enjoy such an
<i>Annuity</i> after so many Years. And this being repeated for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
every Year of the Person's Life, the Sum of all the present Values of
those Chances is the true Value of the Annuity. This will without doubt
appear to be a most laborious Calculation; but it being one of the
principal Uses of this Speculation, and having found some
<i>Compendia</i> for the Work, I took the pains to compute the following
Table, being the short Result of a not ordinary number of Arithmetical
Operations: It shews the Value of Annuities for every Fifth Year of Age,
to the Seventieth, as follows.</p>

<p>This shews the great Advantage of putting Money into the present
<i>Fund</i> lately granted to Their Majesties, giving 14 <i>per Cent.
per Annum</i>, or at the Rate of 7 Years Purchase for a Life; when young
Lives, at the usual Rate of Interest, are worth above 13 Years Purchase.
It shews likewise the Advantage of young Lives over those in Years; a
Life of Ten Years being almost worth 13½ Years Purchase, whereas one of
36 is worth but 11.</p>

<p><i>Use</i> VI. Two Lives are likewise valuable by the same Rule; for
the number of Chances of each single Life, found in the Table, being
multiplied together, become the Chances of the Two Lives. And after any
certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
Term of Years, the Product of the two remaining Sums is the Chances that
both the Persons are living. The Product of the two Differences, being
the numbers of the Dead of both Ages, are the Chances that both the
Persons are dead. And the two Products of the remaining Sums of the one
Age multiplied by those dead of the other, shew the Chances that there
are, that each Party survives the other: Whence is derived the Rule to
estimate the Value of the Remainder of one Life after another. Now as
the Product of the Two Numbers in the Table for the Two Ages proposed,
is to the difference between that Product, and the Product of the two
numbers of Persons deceased in any space of time; so is the Value of a
Sum of Money to be paid after so much time, to the Value thereof under
the Contingency of Mortality. And as the aforesaid Product of the two
Numbers answering to the Ages proposed, to the Product of the Deceased
of one Age multiplied by those remaining alive of the other; so the
Value of a Sum of Money to be paid after any time proposed, to the Value
of the Chances, that the one Party has that he survives the other, whose
number of Deceased you made use of, in the second Term of the
Proportion. This perhaps may be better understood, by putting <i>N</i>
for the number of the younger Age, and <i>n</i> for that of the Elder;
<i>Y</i>, <i>y</i> the Deceased of both Ages respectively, and <i>R</i>,
<i>r</i> for the Remainders; and <i>R + Y</i> = <i>N</i>, and <i>r +
y</i> = <i>n</i>. Then shall <i>Nn</i> be the whole Number of Chances;
<i>Nn - Yy</i> be the Chances that one of the two Persons is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
living, <i>Yy</i> the Chances that they are both dead; <i>Ry</i> the
Chances that the elder Person is dead, and the younger living; and
<i>rY</i> the Chances, that the elder is living, and the younger dead.
Thus two Persons of 18 and 35 are proposed, and after 8 Years these
Chances are required. The Numbers for 18 and 35, are 610 and 490; and
there are 50 of the First Age dead in 8 Years, and 73 of the Elder Age.
There are in all 610 × 490, or 298900 Chances; of these there are 50 ×
73, or 3650, that they are both dead. And as 298900, to 298900 - 3650,
or 295250: So is the present Value of a Sum of Money to be paid after 8
Years, to the present Value of a Sum to be paid, if either of the two
live. And as 560 × 73, so are the Chances that the Elder is dead,
leaving the Younger; and as 417 × 50, so are the Chances that the
Younger is dead, leaving the Elder. Wherefore as 610 × 490 to 560 × 73,
so is the present Value of a Sum to be paid at 8 Years end, to the Sum
to be paid for the Chance of the Younger's Survivance; and as 610 × 490
to 417 × 50, so is the same present Value to the Sum to be paid for the
Chance of the Elder's Survivance.</p>

<p>This possibly may be yet better explained, by expounding these
Products by Rectangular Parallelograms, as in <i>Fig. 7.</i> wherein
<i>AB</i> or <i>CD</i> represents the number of Persons of the younger
Age, and <i>DE</i>, <i>BH</i> those remaining alive after a certain Term
of Years; whence <i>CE</i> will answer the number of those dead in that
time: So <i>AC</i>, <i>BD</i> may represent the number of the elder Age;
<i>AF</i>, <i>BI</i> the Survivors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
after the same Term; and <i>CF</i>, <i>DI</i>, those of that Age that
are dead at that time. Then shall the whole Parallelogram <i>ABCD</i> be
<i>Nn</i>, or the Product of the two Numbers of Persons, representing
such a number of Persons of the two Ages given; and by what was said
before, after the Term proposed, the Rectangle <i>HD</i> shall be as the
number of Persons of the younger Age that survive, and the Rectangle
<i>AE</i> as the number of those that die. So likewise the Rectangles
<i>AI</i>, <i>FD</i> shall be as the Numbers, living and dead, of the
other Age. Hence the Rectangle <i>HI</i> shall be as an equal number of
both Ages surviving. The Rectangle <i>FE</i> being the Product of the
Deceased, or <i>Yy</i>, an equal number of both dead. The Rectangle
<i>GD</i> or <i>Ry</i>, a number living of the younger Age, and dead of
the elder: And the Rectangle <i>AG</i> or <i>rY</i> a number living of
the elder Age, but dead of the younger. This being understood, it is
obvious, that as the whole Rectangle <i>AD</i> or <i>Nn</i> is to the
<i>Gnomon FABDEG</i> or <i>Nn - Yy</i>, so is the whole number of
Persons or Chances, to the number of Chances that one of the two Persons
is living: And as <i>AD</i> or <i>Nn</i> is to <i>FE</i> or <i>Yy</i>,
so are all the Chances, to the Chances that both are dead; whereby may
be computed the Value of the Reversion after both Lives. And as
<i>AD</i> to <i>GD</i> or <i>Ry</i>, so the whole number of Chances, to
the Chances that the younger is living, and the other dead; whereby may
be cast up what Value ought to be paid for the Reversion of one Life
after another, as in the Case of providing for Clergy-men's Widows, and
others, by such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
Reversions. And as <i>AD</i> to <i>AG</i>, or <i>rY</i>, so are all the
Chances, to those that the elder survives the younger. I have been the
more particular, and perhaps tedious, in this Matter, because it is the
Key to the Case of Three Lives, which of it self would not have been so
easie to comprehend.</p>

<p>VII. If Three Lives are proposed, to find the Value of an Annuity
during the continuance of any of those three Lives; the Rule is, <i>As
the Product of the continual Multiplication of the Three Numbers, in the
Table, answering to the Ages proposed, is to the difference of that
Product, and of the Product of the Three Numbers of the Deceased of
those Ages, in any given Term of Years: So is the present Value of a Sum
of Money, to be paid certainly after so many Years, to the present Value
of the same Sum to be paid, provided one of those Three Persons be
living at the Expiration of that Term.</i> Which Proportion being yearly
repeated, the Sum of all those present Values will be the Value of an
Annuity granted for three such Lives. But to explain this, together with
all the Cases of Survivance in Three Lives: Let <i>N</i> be the Number
in the Table for the younger Age, <i>n</i> for the second, and ν for the
elder Age; let <i>Y</i> be those dead of the younger Age in the Term
proposed, <i>y</i> those dead of the second Age, and υ those of the
elder Age; and let <i>R</i> be the Remainder of the younger Age,
<i>r</i> that of the middle Age, and ρ the Remainder of the elder Age.
Then shall <i>R + Y</i> be equal to <i>N</i>, <i>r + y</i> to <i>n</i>,
and ρ + υ to ν, and the continual Product of the three Numbers <i>N</i>,
<i>n</i>, ν, shall be equal to the continual Product of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
<i>R + Y</i> × <i>r + y</i> × ρ + υ, which being the whole Number of
Chances for three Lives, is compounded of the eight Products following.
(1) <i>Rr</i>ρ, which is the Number of Chances that all three of the
Persons are living. (2) <i>r</i>ρ<i>Y</i>, which is the Number of
Chances that the two elder Persons are living, and the younger dead. (3)
<i>R</i>ρ<i>y</i> the Number of Chances that the middle Age is dead, and
the younger and elder living. (4) <i>Rr</i>υ being the Chances that the
two younger are living, and the elder dead. (5) ρ<i>Yy</i> the Chances
that the two younger are dead, and the elder living. (6) <i>rY</i>υ the
Chances that the younger and elder are dead, and the middle Age living.
(7) <i>Ry</i>υ, which are the Chances that the younger is living, and
the two other dead. And Lastly and Eighthly, <i>Yy</i>υ, which are the
Chances that all three are dead. Which latter subtracted from the whole
Number of Chances <i>Nn</i>ν, leaves <i>Nn</i>ν - <i>Yy</i>υ the Sum of
all the other seven Products; in all of which one or more of the three
Persons are surviving.</p>

<p>To make this yet more evident, I have added <i>Fig. 8.</i> wherein
these eight several Products are at one view exhibited. Let the
rectangled Parallelepipedon <i>ABCDEFGH</i> be constituted of the sides
<i>AB</i>, <i>GH</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> proportional to <i>N</i> the Number
of the younger Age; <i>AC</i>, <i>BD</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> proportional to
<i>n</i>; and <i>AG</i>, <i>CE</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> proportional to the
Number of the elder, or ν. And the whole Parallelepipedon shall be as
the Product <i>Nn</i>ν, or our whole Number of Chances. Let <i>BP</i> be
as <i>R</i>, and <i>AP</i> as <i>Y</i>; let <i>CL</i> be as <i>r</i>,
and <i>Ln</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
as <i>y</i>; and <i>GN</i> as ρ, and <i>NA</i> as υ; and let the Plain
<i>PRea</i> be made parallel to the Plain <i>ACGE</i>; the Plain
<i>NVbY</i> parallel to <i>ABCD</i>; and the Plain <i>LXTQ</i> parallel
to the Plain <i>ABGH</i>. And our first Product <i>Rr</i>ρ shall be as
the Solid <i>STWIFZeb</i>. The Second, or <i>r</i>ρ<i>Y</i> will be as
the Solid <i>EYZeQSMI</i>. The Third, <i>R</i>ρ<i>y</i>, as the Solid
<i>RHOVWIST</i>. And the Fourth, <i>Rr</i>υ, as the Solid
<i>ZabDWXIK</i>. Fifthly, ρ<i>Yy</i>, as the Solid <i>GQRSIMNO</i>.
Sixthly, <i>rY</i>υ, as <i>IKLMGYZA</i>. Seventhly, <i>Ry</i>υ, as the
Solid <i>IKPOBXVW</i>. And Lastly, <i>AIKLMNOP</i> will be as the
Product of the 3 Numbers of Persons dead, or <i>Yy</i>υ. I shall not
apply this in all the Cases thereof, for brevity sake; only to shew in
one how all the rest may be performed, let it be demanded what is the
Value of the Reversion of the younger Life after the two elder proposed.
The proportion is as the whole Number of Chances, or <i>Nn</i>ν to the
Product <i>Ry</i>υ; so is the certain present Value of the Sum payable
after any Term proposed, to the Value due to such Chances as the younger
Person has to bury both the elder, by the Term proposed; which therefore
he is to pay for. Here it is to be noted, that the first Term of all
these Proportions is the same throughout, <i>viz.</i> <i>Nn</i>ν. The
second changing yearly according to the Decrease of <i>R</i>, <i>r</i>,
ρ, and Increase of <i>Y</i>, <i>y</i>, υ. And the third are successively
the present Values of Money payable after one, two, three,
<i>&amp;c.</i> years, according to the Rate of Interest agreed on. These
Numbers, which are in all Cases of Annuities of necessary Use, I have
put into the following Table, they being Decimal

<p>It were needless to advertise, that the great trouble of working so
many Proportions will be very much alleviated by using Logarithms; and
that instead of using <i>Nn</i>ν - <i>Yy</i>υ for the second Term of the
Proportion in finding the Value of Three Lives, it may suffice to use
only <i>Yy</i>υ, and then deducting the fourth Term so found out of the
third, the Remainder shall be the present Value sought; or all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
these fourth Terms being added together, and deducted out of the Value
of the certain Annuity for so many Years, will leave the Value of the
contingent Annuity upon the Chance of Mortality of all those Three
Lives. For Example; Let there be Three Lives of 10, 30, and 40 Years of
Age proposed, and the Proportions will be thus;</p>

 <p class="subpara">As 661 in 531 in 445 or 156190995, or <i>Nn</i>ν
 to 8 in 8 in 9, or 576, or <i>Yy</i>υ for the first
 Year, so 0,9434. to 0,00000348.</p>

 <p class="subpara">To 15 in 16 in 18, or 4320, for the second
 Year, so 0,8900. to 0,00002462.</p>

 <p class="subpara">To 21 in 24 in 28, or 14112 for the third
 Year, so 0,8396. to 0,00008128.</p>

 <p class="subpara">To 27 in 32 in 38, for the fourth Year, so
 0,7921. to 0,00016650.</p>

 <p class="subpara">To 33 in 41 in 48, for the fifth Year, so
 0,7473. to 0,00031071.</p>

 <p class="subpara">To 39 in 50 in 58, for the sixth Year, so
 0,7050. to 0,00051051.</p>

<p>And so forth to the 60th Year, when we suppose the elder Life of
Forty certainly to be expired; from whence till Seventy we must compute
for the First and Second only, and from thence to Ninety for the single
youngest Life. Then the Sum Total of all these Fourth Proportionals
being taken out of the Value of a certain Annuity for 90 Years, being
16,58 Years Purchase, shall leave the just Value to be paid for an
Annuity during the whole Term of the Lives of Three Persons of the Ages
proposed. And note, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
will not be necessary to compute for every Year singly; but that in most
Cases every 4th or 5th Year may suffice, interpoling for the
intermediate Years <i>seceundum artem</i>.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that the different <i>Salubrity</i> of Places
does hinder this Proposal from being <i>universal</i>; nor can it be
denied. But by the Number that die, being 1174. <i>per Annum</i> in
34000, it does appear that about a 30th part die yearly, as Sir
<i>William Petty</i> has computed for <i>London</i>; and the Number that
die in Infancy, is a good Argument that the Air is but indifferently
salubrious. So that by what I can learn, there cannot perhaps be one
better Place proposed for a Standard. At least 'tis desired, that in
Imitation hereof the Curious in other Cities would attempt something of
the same Nature, than which nothing perhaps can be more useful.</p>

<p>Were this <i>Calculus</i> founded on the Experience of a very great
number of Years, it would be very well worth the while to think of
Methods for facilitating the Computation of the Value of two, three, or
more Lives; which, as proposed in my former, seems (as I am inform'd) a
Work of too much Difficulty for the ordinary Arithmetician to
undertake.</p>

<p>I have sought, If it were possible, to find a Theorem that might be
more concise than the Rules there laid down, but in vain; for all that
can be done to expedite it, is, by Tables of Logarithms ready computed,
to exhibit the <i>Rationes</i> of <i>N</i> to <i>Y</i> in each single
Life, for every third, fourth, or fifth Year of Age, as occasion shall
require; and these Logarithms being added to the Logarithms of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
present Value of Money payable after so many Years, will give a Series
of Numbers, the Sum of which will shew the Value of the Annuity sought.
However, for each Number of this Series, two Logarithms for a single
Life, three for two Lives, and four for three Lives, must necessarily be
added together. If you think the Matter, under the Uncertainties I have
mentioned, to deserve it, I shall shortly give you such a Table of
Logarithms, as I speak of, and an Example or two of the use thereof: But
by Vulgar Arithmetick, the Labour of these Numbers were immense; and
nothing will more recommend the useful Invention of Logarithms to all
Lovers of Numbers, than the advantage of Dispatch in this and such like
Computations.</p>

<p>Besides the Uses mentioned, it may perhaps not be an unacceptable
thing to infer from the same Tables, how unjustly we repine at the
shortness of our Lives, and think our selves wronged if we attain not
old Age; whereas it appears hereby, that the one half of those that are
born are dead in Seventeen Years time, 1238 being in that time reduced
to 616. So that instead of murmuring at what we call an untimely Death,
we ought with Patience and Unconcern to submit to that Dissolution which
is the necessary Condition of our perishable Materials, and of our nice
and frail Structure and Composition: And to account it as a Blessing
that we have survived, perhaps by many Years, that Period of Life,
whereat the one half of the whole Race of Mankind does not arrive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
A second Observation I make upon the said Table, is that the Growth and
Increase of Mankind is not so much stinted by any thing in the Nature of
the <i>Species</i>, as it is from the cautious difficulty most People
make to adventure on the State of <i>Marriage</i>, from the Prospect of
the Trouble and Charge of providing for a Family. Nor are the poorer
sort of People herein to be blamed, since their difficulty of subsisting
is occasion'd by the unequal Distribution of Possessions, all being
necessarily fed from the Earth, of which yet so few are Masters. So that
besides themselves and Families, they are yet to work for those who own
the Ground that feeds them: And of such does by very much the greater
part of Mankind consist; otherwise it is plain, that there might well be
four times as many Births as we now find. For by Computation from the
Table, I find that there are nearly 15000 Persons above 16, and under
45, of which at least 7000 are Women capable to bear Children. Of these
notwithstanding there are but 1238 born yearly, which is but little more
than a sixth part: So that about one in six of these Women do breed
yearly; whereas were they all married, it would not appear strange or
unlikely, that four of six should bring a Child every Year. The
Political Consequences hereof I shall not insist on; only the Strength
and Glory of a King being in the multitude of his Subjects, I shall only
hint, that above all things, Celibacy ought to be discouraged, as, by
extraordinary Taxing and Military Service: And those who have numerous
Families of Children to be countenanced and encouraged by such Laws as
the <i>Jus trium Liberorum</i> among the <i>Romans</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
But especially, by an effectual Care to provide for the Subsistence of
the Poor, by finding them Employments, whereby they may earn their
Bread, without being chargeable to the Publick.</p>

<h3>A Discourse concerning <strong>Gravity</strong>, and its Properties,
wherein the Descent of <strong>Heavy Bodies</strong>, and the Motion of
<strong>Projects</strong> is briefly, but fully handled: Together with
the <strong>Solution</strong> of a <strong>Problem</strong> of great Use
in <strong>Gunnery</strong>. By <strong>E. Halley</strong>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">NATURE, amidst the great Variety of <i>Problems</i>,
wherewith She exercises the Wits of Philosophical Men, scarce affords
any one wherein the Effect is more visible, and the Cause more
concealed, than in those of the <i>Phænomena</i> of <i>Gravity</i>.
Before we can go alone, we must learn to defend our selves from the
Violence of its Impulse, by not trusting the <i>Center</i> of
<i>Gravity</i> of our Bodies beyond our reach; and yet the acutest
Philosophers, and the subtilest Enquirers into the Original of this
Motion, have been so far from satisfying their Readers, that they
themselves seem little to have understood the Consequences of their own
<i>Hypotheses</i>.</p>

<p><i>Des Cartes</i> his Notion, I must needs confess to be to me
incomprehensible, while he will have the Particles of his <i>Cœlestial
Matter</i>, by being reflected on the Surface of the <i>Earth</i>, and
so ascending therefrom, to drive down into their Places those
<i>Terrestrial Bodies</i> they find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
above them: This is, as near as I can gather, the Scope of the 20, 21,
22, and 23 <i>Sections</i> of the last Book of his <i>Principia
Philosophiæ</i>; yet neither he, nor any of his Followers, can shew how
a Body suspended in <i>Libero Æthere</i>, shall be carried downwards by
a continual Impulse tending upwards, and acting upon all its Parts
equally: And besides the Obscurity wherewith he expresses himself,
particularly, <i>Sect. 23.</i> does sufficiently argue according to his
own Rules, the confused <i>Idea</i> he had of the thing he wrote.</p>

<p>Others, and among them Dr. <i>Vossius</i>, assert the Cause of the
<i>Descent</i> of <i>heavy Bodies</i>, to be the <i>Diurnal Rotation</i>
of the <i>Earth</i> upon its <i>Axis</i>, without considering, that
according to the Doctrine of Motion fortified with Demonstration, all
Bodies moved <i>in Circulo</i>, would recede from the Center of their
Motion; whereby the contrary to <i>Gravity</i> would follow, and all
loose Bodies would be cast into the Air in a <i>Tangent</i> to the
<i>Parallel</i> of <i>Latitude</i>, without the intervention of some
other Principle to keep them fast, such as is that of <i>Gravity</i>.
Besides, the Effect of this Principle is throughout the whole Surface of
the Globe found nearly equal; and certain Experiments have proved it
rather less near the <i>Æquinoctial</i>, than towards the <i>Poles</i>;
which could not be by any means, if the <i>Diurnal Rotation</i> of the
<i>Earth</i> upon its <i>Axis</i> were the Cause of <i>Gravity</i>; for
where the Motion was swiftest, the Effect would be most considerable.</p>

<p>Others assign the Pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i>, to be the Cause
of this Tendency towards the Center of the Earth; but unhappily they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
mistaken the Cause for the Effect; it being from undoubted Principles
plain, that the <i>Atmosphere</i> has no other Pressure but what it
derives from its <i>Gravity</i>; and that the Weight of the upper Parts
of the <i>Air</i>, pressing on the lower Parts thereof, do so far bend
the Springs of that <i>Elastick</i> Body, as to give it a Force equal to
the Weight that compress'd it, having of it self no force at all: And
supposing it had, it will be very hard to explain the <i>Modus</i>, how
that Pressure should occasion the Descent of a Body circumscribed by it,
and pressed equally above and below, without some other Force to draw,
or thrust it downwards. But to demonstrate the contrary of this Opinion,
an <i>Experiment</i> was long since shewn before the <i>Royal
Society</i>, whereby it appeared, that the <i>Atmosphere</i> was so far
from being the Cause of <i>Gravity</i>, that the Effects thereof were
much more vigorous, where the Pressure of the <i>Atmosphere</i> was
taken off; for a long <i>Glass-Receiver</i> having a light Down-feather
included, being evacuated of Air, the Feather, which in the Air would
hardly sink, did <i>in vacuo</i> descend with nearly the same
<i>Velocity</i>, as if it had been a Stone.</p>

<p>Some think to illustrate this Descent of Heavy Bodies, by comparing
it with the Vertue of the <i>Loadstone</i>; but setting aside the
difference there is in the manner of their Attractions, the
<i>Loadstone</i> drawing only in and about its Poles, and the Earth near
equally in all Parts of its Surface, this Comparison avails no more than
to explain <i>ignotum per æque ignotum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
Others assign a certain <i>Sympæthetical Attraction</i> between the
Earth and its Parts, whereby they have, as it were, a desire to be
united, to be the Cause we enquire after: But this is so far from
explaining the <i>Modus</i>, that it is little more, than to tell us in
other Terms, that Heavy Bodies descend, because they descend.</p>

<p>This, I say, not that I can pretend to substitute any Solution of
this Important Philosophical Problem, that shall more happily explicate
the Appearances of Gravity; only it may be serviceable to those with
whom the Credit of great Authors sways much, and who too readily assent
<i>in Verba Magistri</i>, to let them see that their Books are not
always infallible: Besides, the detection of Errors is the first and
surest Step towards the discovery of Truth.</p>

<p>Though the efficient Cause of <i>Gravity</i> be so obscure, yet the
final Cause thereof is clear enough; for it is by this single
<i>Principle</i>, that the <i>Earth</i> and all the <i>Cœlestial
Bodies</i> are kept from <i>Dissolution</i>; the least of their
<i>Particles</i> not being suffer'd to recede far from their
<i>Surfaces</i>, without being immediately brought down again by Virtue
of this <i>Natural Tendency</i>; which, for their Preservation, the
Infinite Wisdom of their <i>Creator</i> has ordained to be towards each
of their <i>Centers</i>; nor can the <i>Globes</i> of the <i>Sun</i> and
<i>Planets</i> otherwise be destroy'd, but by taking from them this
Power of keeping their Parts united.</p>

<p>The Affections or Properties of <i>Gravity</i>, and its manner of
acting upon <i>Bodies falling</i>, have been in a great measure
discovered, and most of them made out by <i>Mathematical
Demonstration</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
in this our <i>Century</i>, by the accurate diligence of
<i>Galilæus</i>, <i>Torricellius</i>, <i>Hugenius</i>, and others, and
now lately by our worthy Countryman, Mr. <i>Isaac Newton</i>, which
Properties it may be very material here to enumerate, that they may
serve for a Foundation to all those that shall be willing to spend their
Thoughts in search of the true Cause of this <i>Descent of Bodies</i>.</p>

<p>The first Property is, That by this Principle of <i>Gravitation</i>,
all Bodies do descend towards a Point, which either is, or else is very
near to the Center of Magnitude of the Earth and Sea, about which the
Sea forms it self exactly into a <i>Spherical Surface</i>, and the
<i>Prominences</i> of the Land, considering the Bulk of the whole,
differ but insensibly therefrom.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That this Point or Center of <i>Gravitation</i>, is
fix'd within the <i>Earth</i>, or at least has been so, ever since we
have any <i>Authentick History</i>: For a Consequence of its Change,
though never so little, would be the over-flowing of the low Lands on
that side of the <i>Globe</i> towards which it approached, and the
leaving new Islands bare on the opposite side, from which it receded;
but for this Two Thousand Years it appears, that the low Islands of the
<i>Mediterranean Sea</i> (near to which the ancientest Writers liv'd)
have continued much at the same height above the Water, as they now are
found; and no <i>Inundations</i> or <i>Recesses</i> of the <i>Sea</i>
arguing any such Change, are recorded in History; excepting the
<i>Universal Deluge</i>, which can no better way be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
accounted for, than by supposing this Center of <i>Gravitation</i>
removed for a time, towards the middle of the then inhabited Parts of
the World; and a change of its Place, but the Two Thousandth Part of the
<i>Radius</i> of this <i>Globe</i>, were sufficient to bury the Tops of
the highest Hills under Water.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, That in all Parts of the <i>Surface</i> of the
<i>Earth</i>, or rather in all Points equidistant from its
<i>Center</i>, the Force of <i>Gravity</i> is nearly equal; so that the
length of the <i>Pendulum</i> vibrating <i>Seconds of Time</i>, is found
in all Parts of the World to be very near the same. 'Tis true at St.
<i>Helena</i>, in the <i>Latitude</i> of 16 Degrees <i>South</i>, I
found that the <i>Pendulum</i> of my Clock, which vibrated
<i>Seconds</i>, needed to be made shorter than it had been in
<i>England</i>, by a very sensible Space (but which at that time I
neglected to observe accurately) before it would keep time; and since
the like Observations have been made by the <i>French Observers</i>,
near the <i>Æquinoctial</i>: Yet I dare not affirm, that in mine it
proceeded from any other Cause, than the great Height of my Place of
Observation above the <i>Surface</i> of the <i>Sea</i>, whereby the
<i>Gravity</i> being diminished, the length of the <i>Pendulum</i>
vibrating <i>Seconds</i>, is proportionably short'ned.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, That <i>Gravity</i> does equally affect all
<i>Bodies</i>, without regard either to their <i>Matter</i>,
<i>Bulk</i>, or <i>Figure</i>; so that the Impediment of the
<i>Medium</i> being removed, the most compact and most loose, the
greatest and smallest <i>Bodies</i> would descend the same <i>Spaces</i>
in equal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
Times; the Truth thereof will appear from the Experiment I before-cited.
In these two last Particulars, is shewn the great difference between
<i>Gravity</i> and <i>Magnetism</i>, the one affecting only <i>Iron</i>,
and that towards its <i>Poles</i>, the other all <i>Bodies</i> alike in
every part. As a <i>Corollary</i>, from hence it will follow, that there
is no such thing as <i>positive Levity</i>, those things that appear
light, being only comparatively so; and whereas several things rise and
swim in <i>Fluids</i>, 'tis because, Bulk for Bulk, they are not so
heavy as those <i>Fluids</i>; nor is there any Reason why <i>Cork</i>,
for Instance, should be said to be light, because it swims on Water, any
more than <i>Iron</i>, because it swims on <i>Mercury</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, That this Power increases as you descend, and
decreases as you ascend from the Center, and that in the Proportion of
the Squares of the <i>Distances</i> therefrom <i>reciprocally</i>, so as
at a double Distance to have but a quarter of the Force; this Property
is the Principle on which Mr. <i>Newton</i> has made out all the
<i>Phænomena</i> of the <i>Cœlestial Motions</i>, so easily and
naturally, that its Truth is past Dispute. Besides that, it is highly
rational, that the <i>attractive</i> or <i>gravitating</i> Power should
exert it self more vigorously in a small Sphere, and weaker in a
greater, in proportion as it is contracted or expanded; and if so,
seeing that the <i>Surfaces</i> of <i>Spheres</i> are as the
<i>Squares</i> of their <i>Radii</i>, this Power, at several Distances,
will be as the <i>Squares</i> of those <i>Distances reciprocally</i>;
and then its whole Action upon each <i>Spherical Surface</i>, be it
great or small, will be always equal. And this is evidently the Rule of
<i>Gravitation</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
towards the <i>Centers</i> of the <i>Sun</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>,
<i>Saturn</i> and the <i>Earth</i>, and thence is reasonably inferred,
to be the general Principle observed by <i>Nature</i>, in all the rest
of the <i>Cœlestial Bodies</i>.</p>

<p>These are the principal Affections of <i>Gravity</i>, from which the
Rules of the <i>Fall</i> of <i>Bodies</i>, and the <i>Motion</i> of
<i>Projects</i> are <i>Mathematically</i> deducible. Mr. <i>Isaac
Newton</i> has shew'd how to define the Spaces of the <i>Descent</i> of
a <i>Body</i>, let fall from any given height, down to the
<i>Center</i>, supposing the <i>Gravitation</i> to increase, as in the
fifth Property; but considering the smallness of heighth, to which any
<i>Project</i> can be made ascend, and over how little an <i>Arch</i> of
the <i>Globe</i> it can be cast by any of our <i>Engines</i>, we may
well enough suppose the <i>Gravity</i> equal throughout, and the
Descents of <i>Projects</i> in parallel Lines, which in Truth are
towards the <i>Center</i>, the difference being so small as by no means
to be discovered in <i>Practice</i>. The <i>Opposition</i> of the
<i>Air</i>, 'tis true, is considerable against all light Bodies moving
through it, as likewise against small ones (of which more hereafter) but
in great and ponderous Shot, this Impediment is found by
<i>Experience</i> but very small, and may safely be neglected.</p>

<p class="gap-above center"><i>Propositions concerning the Descent of Heavy
Bodies, and the Motion of <strong>Projects</strong>.</i></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> I. The <i>Velocities</i> of <i>Falling Bodies</i>, are
proportionate to the Times from the beginning of their <i>Falls</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
This follows, for that the Action of <i>Gravity</i> being
<i>continual</i>, in every Space of Time, the falling Body receives a
new Impulse, equal to what it had before, in the same Space of Time,
received from the same Power: For Instance, in the first Second of Time,
the falling Body has acquired a <i>Velocity</i>, which in that time
would carry it to a certain Distance, suppose 32 Foot, and were there no
new Force, would descend at that rate with an <i>equable Motion</i>: But
in the next Second of Time, the same Power of <i>Gravity</i> continually
acting thereon, superadds a new <i>Velocity</i> equal to the former; so
that at the end of two Seconds, the <i>Velocity</i> is double to what it
was at the end of the first, and after the same manner may it be proved
to be triple, at the end of the third Second, and so on. Wherefore the
<i>Velocities</i> of <i>falling Bodies</i>, are proportionate to the
Time of their <i>Falls</i>, <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> II. The <i>Spaces</i> described by the Fall of
a Body, are as the <i>Squares</i> of the Times, from
the beginning of the <i>Fall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Demonstration.</i> Let AB (<i>Fig. 9. Tab. 4.</i>) represent the
<i>Time</i> of the <i>Fall</i> of a <i>Body</i>, BC perpendicular to AB,
the <i>Velocity</i> acquired at the end of the <i>Fall</i>, and draw the
Line AC; then divide the Line AB representing the Time, into as many
equal Parts as you please, as b, b, b, b, <i>&amp;c.</i> and through
these Points draw the Lines bc, bc, bc, bc, <i>&amp;c.</i> parallel to
BC, 'tis manifest that the several Lines, bc, represent the several
<i>Velocities</i> of the falling Body, in such Parts of the <i>Time</i>
as Ab is of AB, by the former Proposition. It is evident likewise, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
<i>Area</i> ABC is the Sum of all the Lines bc being taken, according to
the Method of <i>Indivisibles</i>, infinitely many; so that the
<i>Area</i> ABC represents the Sum of all the <i>Velocities</i>, between
none and BC supposed infinitely many; which Sum is as the Space
descended in the Time represented by AB. And by the same Reason the
<i>Areas</i> Abc, will represent the Spaces descended in the Times Ab;
so then the Spaces descended in the Times AB, Ab, are as the
<i>Areas</i> of the <i>Triangles</i> ABC, Abc, which by the 20th of the
6 of <i>Euclid</i>, are as the <i>Squares</i> of their <i>Homologous
Sides</i> AB, Ab, that is to say, of the <i>Times</i>: Wherefore the
Descents of <i>falling Bodies</i>, are as the <i>Squares</i> of the
Times of their <i>Fall</i>, <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> III. The <i>Velocity</i> which a
<i>falling Body</i> acquires in any Space of time, is double to that,
wherewith it would have moved the Space, descended by an equable Motion,
in the same <i>time</i>.</p>

<p><i>Demonstration.</i> Draw the Line EC parallel to AB, and AE
parallel to BC in the same <i>Fig. 9.</i> and compleat the
<i>Parallelogram</i> ABCE, it is evident that the <i>Area</i> thereof
may represent the Space, a <i>Body</i> moved equably with the
<i>Velocity</i> BC would describe in the Time AB, and the
<i>Triangle</i> ABC represents the <i>Space</i> describ'd by the
<i>Fall</i> of a <i>Body</i>, in the same Time AB, by the second
Proposition. Now the <i>Triangle</i> ABC is half of the
<i>Parallelogram</i> ABCE, and consequently the Space described by the
<i>Fall</i>, is half what would have been described by an <i>equable
Motion</i> with the <i>Velocity</i> BC, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
same Time; wherefore the <i>Velocity</i> BC at the end of the
<i>Fall</i>, is double to that <i>Velocity</i>, which in the Time AB,
would have described the <i>Space fallen</i>, represented by the
<i>Triangle</i> ABC with an <i>equable Motion</i>, <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> IV. All <i>Bodies</i> on or near the
Surface of the <i>Earth</i>, in their <i>Fall</i>, descend so, as at the
end of the first Second of Time, they have described 16 Feet, 1 Inch,
<i>London Measure</i>, and acquired the <i>Velocity</i> of 32 Feet, 2
Inches, in a Second.</p>

<p>This is made out from the 25th Proposition of the second Part of that
excellent Treatise of Mr. <i>Hugenius de Horologio Oscillatorio</i>;
wherein he demonstrates the time of the least <i>Vibrations</i> of a
<i>Pendulum</i>, to be to the Time of the <i>Fall</i> of a <i>Body</i>,
from the heighth of half the length of the <i>Pendulum</i>, as the
<i>Circumference</i> of a <i>Circle</i> to its <i>Diameter</i>; whence,
as a <i>Corollary</i>, it follows, That as the <i>Square</i> of the
<i>Diameter</i> to the <i>Square</i> of the <i>Circumference</i>, so
half the length of the <i>Pendulum</i> vibrating <i>Seconds</i>, to the
<i>Space</i> described by the <i>Fall</i> of a <i>Body</i> in a
<i>Second</i> of <i>Time</i>: And the Length of the <i>Pendulum</i>
vibrating <i>Seconds</i>, being found 39, 125, or ⅛ Inches, the
<i>Descent</i> in a <i>Second</i> will be found by the aforesaid
<i>Analogy</i> 16 Foot and 1 Inch; and, by the third Proposition, the
<i>Velocity</i> will be double thereto; and near to this it hath been
found by several Experiments, which by reason of the <i>swiftness</i> of
the <i>Fall</i>, cannot so exactly determine its <i>Quantity</i>. The
Demonstration of <i>Hugenius</i> being the Conclusion of a long Train of
<i>Consequences</i>, I shall for brevity sake omit; and refer you to his
Book, where these things are more amply treated of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
From these Four <i>Propositions</i>, all <i>Questions</i> concerning the
<i>Perpendicular Fall of Bodies</i>, are easily <i>solved</i>, and
either <i>Time</i>, <i>Height</i>, or <i>Velocity</i> being assign'd,
one may readily find the other two. From them likewise is the Doctrine
of <i>Projects</i> deducible, assuming the two following <i>Axioms</i>;
<i>viz.</i> That a <i>Body</i> set a moving, will move on continually in
a right <i>Line</i> with an <i>equable Motion</i>, unless some other
Force or Impediment intervene, whereby it is accelerated, or retarded,
or deflected.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, That a <i>Body</i> being agitated by two
<i>Motions</i> at a time, does by their <i>compounded Forces</i> pass
through the same <i>Points</i>, as it would do, were the two <i>Motions
divided</i> and acted <i>successively</i>. As for Instance, Suppose a
<i>Body</i> moved in the Line GF, (<i>Fig. 1. Tab. 5.</i>) from G to R,
and there stopping, by another <i>Impulse</i>, suppose it moved in a
<i>Space</i> of <i>Time</i> equal to the former, from R towards K, to V.
I say, the <i>Body</i> shall pass through the Point to V, though these
two <i>several Forces</i> acted both in the <i>same time</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> V. The <i>Motion</i> of all
<i>Projects</i> is in the <i>Curve</i> of a <i>Parabola</i>: Let the
<i>Line</i> GRF (in <i>Fig.</i> 1.) be the <i>Line</i> in which the
<i>Project</i> is directed, and in which by the first <i>Axiom</i> it
would move equal <i>Spaces</i> in equal <i>Times</i>, were it not
deflected downwards by the Force of <i>Gravity</i>. Let GB be the
<i>Horizontal Line</i>, and GC a <i>Perpendicular</i> thereto. Then the
<i>Line</i> GRF being divided into equal Parts, answering to equal
<i>Spaces</i> of <i>Time</i>, let the <i>Descents</i> of the
<i>Project</i> be laid down in <i>Lines parallel</i> to GC, proportioned
as the <i>Squares</i> of the <i>Lines</i> GS, GR, GL, GF, or as the
<i>Squares</i> of the <i>Times</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
from S to T, from R to V, from L to X, and from F to B, and draw the
<i>Lines</i> TH, VD, XY, BC parallel to GF; I say, the Points T, V, X,
B, are Points in the <i>Curve</i> described by the <i>Project</i>, and
that that <i>Curve</i> is a <i>Parabola</i>. By the second <i>Axiom</i>,
they are Points in the <i>Curve</i>; and the Parts of the <i>Descent</i>
GH, GD, GY, GC, = to ST, RV, LX, FB, being as the <i>Squares</i> of the
<i>Times</i> (by the <i>Second Proposition</i>) that is, as the
<i>Squares</i> of the <i>Ordinates</i>, HT, DU, YX, BC, equal to GS, GR,
GL, GF, the <i>Spaces</i> measured in those Times; and there being no
other <i>Curve</i> but the <i>Parabola</i>, whose Parts of the
<i>Diameter</i> are as the <i>Squares</i> of the <i>Ordinates</i>, it
follows that the <i>Curve</i> describ'd by a <i>Project</i>, can be no
other than a <i>Parabola</i>: And saying, as RU the <i>Descent</i> in
any <i>time</i>, to GR or UD the <i>direct Motion</i> in the same
<i>time</i>, so is UD to a <i>third</i> proportional; that <i>third</i>
will be the <i>Line</i> call'd by all Writers of <i>Conicks</i>, the
<i>Parameter</i> of the <i>Parabola</i> to the <i>Diameter</i> GC, which
is always the same in <i>Projects</i> cast with the same
<i>Velocity</i>: And the <i>Velocity</i> being defined by the Number of
<i>Feet</i> moved in a <i>Second</i> of Time, the <i>Parameter</i> will
be found by dividing the <i>Square</i> of the <i>Velocity</i>, by 16
<i>Feet</i>, 1 <i>Inch</i>, the <i>Fall</i> of a <i>Body</i> in the same
<i>Time</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lemma.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Sine</i> of the double of any <i>Arch</i>, is equal to twice the

<i>Arch</i> is equal to twice the <i>Square</i> of the <i>Sine</i>
thereof divided by <i>Radius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315"

Tab. 5.</i>) be double the <i>Arch</i> BF, and A the <i>Center</i>; draw
the <i>Radii</i> AB, AF, AC, and the <i>Chord</i> BDC, and let fall BE
perpendicular to AC, and the <i>Angle</i> EBC, will be equal to the
<i>Angle</i> ABD, and the <i>Triangle</i> BCE, will be like to the
<i>Triangle</i> BDA; wherefore it will be as AB to AD, so BC or twice
BD, to BE; that is, as <i>Radius</i> to <i>Co-sine</i>, so twice
<i>Sine</i> to <i>Sine</i> of the double <i>Arch</i>. And as AB to BD,
so twice BD or BC to EC, that is, as <i>Radius</i> to <i>Sine</i>, so
twice that <i>Sine</i>, to the <i>Versed Sine</i> of the double
<i>Arch</i>; which two <i>Analogies</i> resolved into <i>Equations</i>,
are the <i>Propositions</i> contained in the <i>Lemma</i> to be
proved.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> VI. The <i>Horizontal</i> Distances of
<i>Projections</i> made with the same <i>Velocity</i>, at several
<i>Elevations</i> of the <i>Line</i> of Direction, are as the
<i>Sines</i> of the doubled <i>Angles</i> of <i>Elevation</i>.</p>

<p>Let GB (<i>Fig.</i> 1) the <i>Horizontal</i> Distance be = <i>z</i>,
the <i>Sine</i> of the <i>Angle</i> of <i>Elevation</i>, FGB, be =
<i>s</i>, its <i>Co-sine</i> = <i>c</i>, <i>Radius</i> = <i>r</i>, and
the <i>Parameter</i> = <i>p</i>. It will be as <i>c</i> to <i>s</i>; so
<i>z</i> to <sup><i>sz</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>c</i></sub> = FB = GC,
and by reason of the <i>Parabola</i>
<sup><i>psz</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>c</i></sub> = to the <i>Square</i>
of CB, or GF; Now as <i>c</i> to <i>r</i>, so is <i>z</i> to
<sup><i>zr</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>c</i></sub> = GF, and its
<i>Square</i> <sup><i>zzrr</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>cc</i></sub> will be
therefore = to <sup><i>psz</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>c</i></sub>: Which
<i>Equation</i> reduced will be
<sup><i>psc</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>rr</i></sub> = <i>z</i>. But by the
former <i>Lemma</i> <sup>2<i>sc</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>r</i></sub> is
equal to the <i>Sine</i> of the double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
<i>Angle</i>, whereof <i>s</i> is the <i>Sine</i>: Wherefore 'twill be
as <i>Radius</i> to <i>Sine</i> of double the <i>Angle</i> FGB, so is
half the <i>Parameter</i>, to the <i>Horizontal Range</i> or
<i>Distance</i> sought; and at the several <i>Elevations</i>, the
<i>Ranges</i> are as the <i>Sines</i> of the double <i>Angles</i> of
<i>Elevation</i>, <i>Q. E. D.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Corollary.</i></p>

<p>Hence it follows, that half the <i>Parameter</i> is the greatest
<i>Randon</i>, and that that happens at the <i>Elevation</i> of 45
Degrees, the <i>Sine</i> of whose double is <i>Radius</i>. Likewise that
the <i>Ranges</i> equally distant above and below 45 are equal, as are
the <i>Sines</i> of all double <i>Arches</i>, to the <i>Sines</i> of
their doubled <i>Complements</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> VII. The <i>Altitudes</i> of
<i>Projections</i> made with the same <i>Velocity</i>, at several
<i>Elevations</i>, are as the <i>versed Sines</i> of the doubled
<i>Angles</i> of <i>Elevation</i>: As <i>c</i> is to <i>s</i>; so is
<sup><i>psc</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>rr</i></sub> = GB to
<sup><i>pss</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>rr</i></sub> = BF: and UK = RU =
BF/4, the <i>Altitude</i> of the <i>Projection</i> =
<sup><i>psc</i></sup>&frasl;<sub>4<i>rr</i></sub>. Now by the foregoing
<i>Lemma</i> <sup>2<i>ss</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>r</i></sub> = to the
<i>versed Sine</i> of the double <i>Angle</i>, and therefore it will be
as <i>Radius</i>, to <i>versed Sine</i> of double the <i>Angle</i> FGB,
so an 8th of the <i>Parameter</i> to the height of the <i>Projection</i>
VK; and so these heights at several <i>Elevations</i>, are as the said

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
<i>Corollary.</i></p>

<p>From hence it is plain, that the greatest <i>Altitude</i> of the
perpendicular <i>Projection</i> is a 4th of <i>Parameter</i>, or half
the greatest <i>Horizontal Range</i>; the <i>versed Sine</i> of 180
Degrees being = <i>2r</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> VIII. The <i>Lines</i> GF, or Times of
the Flight of a <i>Project</i> cast with the same Degree of

<p>As <i>c</i> is to <i>r</i>; so is
<sup><i>psc</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>rr</i></sub> = GB by the 6 Prop. to
<sup><i>ps</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>r</i></sub> GF; that is, as
<i>Radius</i> to <i>Sine</i> of <i>Elevation</i>, so the

the <i>Sines</i> of <i>Elevation</i>, and the <i>Times</i> are
proportional to those <i>Lines</i>; wherefore the <i>Times</i> are as
the <i>Sines</i> of <i>Elevation</i>: <i>Ergo constat propositio</i>.</p>

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> IX. Problem. A <i>Projection</i> being

<p><i>Solution.</i> As <i>Radius</i> to <i>Secant</i> of FGB, so GM the

so then the sum and difference of the afore-found <i>Quote</i>, and this
<i>Tangent</i> will be the Roots of the <i>Equation</i>, and the
<i>Tangents</i> of the <i>Elevations</i> sought.</p>

<p>Note here, that in <i>Descents</i>, if the <i>Tangent</i> exceed the
<i>Quote</i>, as it does when <i>ph</i> is more than <i>bb</i>, the
<i>direction</i> of the lower <i>Elevation</i> will be below the
<i>Horizon</i>, and if <i>ph</i> = <i>bb</i>, it must be directed
<i>Horizontal</i>, and the <i>Tangent</i> of the upper <i>Elevation</i>
will be <sup><i>pr</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>b</i></sub>: Note likewise,
that if 4<i>bb</i> + 4<i>ph</i> in <i>Ascents</i>, or 4<i>bb</i> -
4<i>ph</i> in <i>Descents</i>, be equal to <i>pp</i>, there is but one
<i>Elevation</i> that can hit the <i>Object</i>, and its <i>Tangent</i>
is <sup><i>pr</i></sup>&frasl;<sub>2<i>b</i></sub>. And if 4<i>bb</i> +
4<i>ph</i> in <i>Ascents</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320"
id="Page_320">{320}</a></span> or 4<i>bb</i> - 4<i>ph</i> in
<i>descents</i>, do exceed <i>pp</i>, the <i>Object</i> is without the
reach of a <i>Project</i> cast with that <i>Velocity</i>, and so the
thing impossible.</p>

<p>From this <i>Equation</i> 4<i>bb</i> ∓ 4<i>ph</i> = <i>pp</i> are
determined the utmost limits of the reach of any <i>Project</i>, and the
Figure assigned, wherein are all the <i>heights</i> upon each
<i>Horizontal distance</i> beyond which it cannot pass; for by reduction
of that <i>Equation</i>, <i>h</i> will be found = ¼<i>p</i> -
<sup><i>bb</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>p</i></sub> in <i>heights</i>, and
<sup><i>bb</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>p</i></sub> - ¼<i>p</i> in

are in the <i>Curve</i> of the <i>Parabola</i>, whose <i>Focus</i> is
the Point from whence the <i>Project</i> is cast, and whose <i>Latus
rectum</i>, or <i>Parameter ad Axem</i> is = <i>p</i>. Likewise from the
same <i>Equation</i> may the least <i>Parameter</i> or <i>Velocity</i>
be found capable to reach the <i>Object</i> proposed; for <i>bb</i> =

which is the <i>Horizontal Range</i> at 45 degrees, of a Project cast
with the least Velocity that would just reach the <i>Object</i>, and the
<i>Elevation</i> requisite will be easily had; for dividing the so found
<i>Semi-parameter</i> by the <i>Horizontal distance</i> given <i>b</i>,
the <i>Quote</i> into <i>Radius</i> will be the <i>Tangent</i> of the

<i>Bombardiers</i> and <i>Gunners</i>, not only that they may use no
more Powder than is necessary, to cast their <i>Bombs</i> into the place
assigned, but that they may shoot with much more certainty, for that a

Hypothenusal Distance of the Object; and with the Center A and Radius FB

possible, intersect the indeterminate Perpendicular DF in two Points K

<p class="gap-above"><i>Prop.</i> XI. To determine the Force or
<i>Velocity</i> of a <i>Project</i>, in every Point of the <i>Curve</i>
it describes.</p>

<p>To do this we need no other <i>Præcognita</i>, but only the third
Proposition, <i>viz.</i> That the <i>Velocity</i> of <i>falling
Bodies</i>, is double to that which in the same time, would have
described the Space <i>fallen</i> by an equable Motion: For the
<i>Velocity</i> of a Project, is compounded of the constant equal
<i>Velocity</i> of the impressed Motion, and the <i>Velocity</i> of the
<i>Fall</i>, under a given <i>Angle</i>, <i>viz.</i> the Complement of
the <i>Elevation</i>: For Instance, in <i>Fig. 2.</i> in the time
wherein a Project would move from G to L, it descends from L to X, and
by the third <i>Proposition</i> has acquired a <i>Velocity</i>, which in
that time would have carried it by an equable Motion from L to Z, or
twice the Descent LX; and drawing the Line GZ, I say, the
<i>Velocity</i> in the Point X, compounded of the <i>Velocities</i> GL
and LZ under the Angle GLZ, is to the <i>Velocity</i> impress'd in the
Point G, as GZ is to GL; this follows from our second <i>Axiom</i>, and
by the 20 and 21 <i>Prop. lib. 1. conic. Midorgii</i>, XO parallel and
equal to GZ shall touch the <i>Parabola</i> in the Point X. So that the
<i>Velocities</i> in the several Points, are as the lengths of the
<i>Tangents</i> to the <i>Parabola</i> in those Points, intercepted
between any two <i>Diameters</i>: And these again are as the
<i>Secants</i> of the <i>Angles</i>, which those <i>Tangents</i>
continued make with the <i>Horizontal</i> Line GB. From what is here
laid down,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
may the comparative Force of a <i>Shot</i> in any two Points of the
<i>Curve</i>, be either <i>Geometrically</i> or <i>Arithmetically</i>
discover'd.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Corollary.</i></p>

<p>From hence it follows, that the force of a Shot is always least at U,
or the <i>Vertex</i> of the <i>Parabola</i>, and that at equal distances
therefrom, as at T and X, G and B its force is always equal, and that
the least force in U is to that in G and B, as <i>Radius</i> to the
Secant of the <i>Angle</i> of <i>Elevation</i> FGB.</p>

<p class="gap-above">These <i>Propositions</i> considered, there is no
question relating to <i>Projects</i>, which, by the help of them, may
not easily be Solved; and tho' it be true that most of them are to be
met withal, in <i>Galileus</i>, <i>Torricellius</i> and others, who have
taken them from those Authors, yet their Books being Foreign, and not
easy to come by, and their <i>Demonstrations</i> long and difficult, I
thought it not amiss to give the whole <i>Doctrine</i> here in
<i>English</i>, with such short <i>Analytical</i> Proof of my own, as
might be sufficient to evince their Truth.</p>

<p>The Tenth <i>Proposition</i> contains a <i>Problem</i>, untouch'd by
<i>Torricellius</i>, which is of the greatest use in <i>Gunnery</i>, and
for the sake of which this <i>Discourse</i> was principally intended: It
was first Solved by Mr. <i>Anderson</i>, in his Book of the Genuine Use
and Effects of the <i>Gun</i>, Printed in the Year 1674; but his
Solution required so much Calculation, that it put me upon search,
whether it might not be done more easily, and thereupon in the Year 1678
I found out the Rule I now Publish, and from it the <i>Geometrical</i>
Construction: Since which time there has a large <i>Treatise</i> of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
Subject, Intituled, <i>L'Art dejetter les Bombes</i>, been Published by
<i>Monsieur Blondel</i>, wherein he gives the Solutions of this
<i>Problem</i> by <i>Messieurs Buot</i>, <i>Romer</i> and <i>de la
Hire</i>: But none of them being the same with Mine, or, in my Opinion,
more easy, and most of them more Operose, and besides mine finding the
<i>Tangent</i>, which generally determines the <i>Angle</i> better than
its <i>Sine</i>, I thought my self obliged to Print it for the use of
all such, as desire to be informed in the <i>Mathematical</i> part of
the Art of <i>Gunnery</i>.</p>

<p>Now these Rules were rigidly true, were it not, as I said before, for
the Opposition of the Medium, whereby not only the direct imprest Motion
is continually retarded, but likewise the increase of the
<i>Velocity</i> of the <i>Fall</i>, so that the Spaces described
thereby, are not exactly as the Squares of the Times: But what this
Opposition of the <i>Air</i> is, against several <i>Velocities</i>,
<i>Bulks</i>, and <i>Weights</i>, is not so easie to determine. 'Tis
certain that the weight of <i>Air</i> to that of <i>Water</i>, is nearly
as 1 to 800, whence the weight thereof, to that of any <i>Project</i> is
given; 'tis very likely, that to the same <i>Velocity</i> and
<i>Magnitude</i>, but of different Matter, the <i>Opposition</i> should
be <i>reciprocally</i> as the weights of the Shot; as likewise that to
Shot of the same <i>Velocity</i> and Matter, but of different
<i>Sizes</i>, it should be as the <i>Diameters reciprocally</i>: Whence
generally the <i>Opposition</i> to Shot with the same <i>Velocity</i>,
but of differing <i>Diameters</i>, and <i>Materials</i>, should be as
their <i>Specifick Gravities</i> into their <i>Diameters
reciprocally</i>; but whether the <i>Opposition</i>, to differing
<i>Velocities</i> of the same Shot, be as the <i>Squares</i> of those
<i>Velocities</i>, or as the <i>Velocities</i> themselves, or otherwise,
is yet a harder Question. However it be, 'tis certain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
that in large Shot of <i>Metal</i>, whose weight many Thousand times
surpasses that of the <i>Air</i>, and whose force is very great, in
proportion to the <i>Surface</i> wherewith they press thereon; this
<i>Opposition</i> is scarce discernable; For by several
<i>Experiments</i> made with all Care and Circumspection with a
<i>Mortarpiece</i>, Extraordinary well fix'd to the Earth on purpose,
which carried a solid Brass Shot of four Inches and a half
<i>Diameter</i>, and of about fourteen Pound Weight, the <i>Ranges</i>
above and below forty five <i>Degrees</i> were found nearly equal; if
there were any difference, the under <i>Ranges</i> went rather the
farthest, but those differences were usually less than the Errors
committed in ordinary Practice, by the unequal Goodness and Dryness of
the same sort of Powder, by the Unfitness of the Shot to the Bore, and
by the Loosness of the Carriage.</p>

<p>In a smaller Brass-Shot of about an Inch and half Diameter, cast by a
Cross-Bow which ranged it, at most about four Hundred Foot, the Force
being much more equal than in the Mortarpiece, this difference was found
more Curiously: and Constantly and most Evidently, the under Ranges
out-went the upper. From which Trials I conclude, that although in small
and light Shot, the Opposition of the Air, ought and must be accounted
for; yet in Shooting of great and weighty Bombs, there need be very
little or no allowance made; and so these Rules may be put in practice
to all Intents and Purposes, as if this Impediment were absolutely
remov'd.</p>

<h4><i>A Proposition of general Use in the Art of Gunnery,
shewing the Rule of laying a Mortar to
pass, in order to strike an Object above or below
the Horizon.</i></h4>

<p>It was formerly the Opinion of those concerned in Artillery, that
there was a certain requisite of Powder for each Gun, and that in
Mortars, where the distance was to be varied, it must be done by giving
a greater or lesser Elevation to the Piece. But now our later Experience
has taught us that the same thing may be more certainly and readily
performed by increasing and diminishing the quantity of Powder, whether
regard be had to the Execution to be done, or to the Charge of doing it.
For when Bombs are discharged with great Elevations of the Mortar, they
fall too Perpendicular, and bury themselves too deep in the Ground, to
do all that damage they might, if they came more Oblique, and broke upon
or near the Surface of the Earth; which is a thing acknowledg'd by the
Besieged in all Towns, who unpave their Streets, to let the Bombs bury
themselves, and thereby stifle the force of their Splinters. A Second
Convenience is, that at the extream Elevation, the Gunner is not obliged
to be so curious in the direction of his Piece, but it will suffice to
be within a Degree or two of the Truth; whereas in the other Method of
Shooting he ought to be very curious. But a Third, and no less
considerable Advantage is, in the saving the Prince's Powder, which in
so great and so numerous Discharges, as we have lately seen, must needs
amount to a considerable Value. And for Sea-Mortars, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
scarce practicable otherwise to use them, where the agitation of the Sea
continually changes the Direction of the Mortar, and would render the
Shot very uncertain, were it not that they are placed about 45 Degrees
Elevation, where several Degrees above or under, make very little
difference in the Effect.</p>

<p>In the precedent Discourse, I considered all the Propositions
relating to the Motion of Projectiles, and gave a Solution to this
Problem; <i>viz.</i> <i>To hit an Object above or below the Horizontal
Line with the greatest Certainty and least Force.</i> That is, that the
Horizontal distance of the Object being put = <i>b</i>, and the
Perpendicular Heighth = <i>b</i>, the Charge requisite to strike the
Object with the greatest Advantage, was that which with an Elevation of
45° would cast the Shot on the Horizontal Line, to the distance of
<span class="radical-1">&radic;</span>&zwj;
<span class="radicand-1"><i>bb +hh</i></span>&thinsp;,
when the Object was above the Horizon; or if it were below it, the
Charge must be lesser, so as to reach on the Horizon, at 45° Elevation,
no greater a Distance than
<span class="radical-1">&radic;</span>&zwj;
<span class="radicand-1"><i>bb + hh</i></span>&thinsp; - <i>h</i>;
that is, in the one Case, the Sum of the Hypothenusal Distance of the
Object from the Gun, and the Perpendicular Heighth thereof above the
Gun; and in the other Case, when the Object is below the Horizon, the
difference of the same <i>per</i> 47. I <i>Eucl.</i> And I then shew'd
how to find the Elevation proper for the Gun so charged, <i>viz.</i> As
the Horizontal Distance of the Object, to the Sum or Difference of the
Hypothenusal Distance and Perpendicular Height: So Radius to the Tangent
of the Elevation sought. But I was not at that time aware that the
aforesaid Elevation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
did constantly bisect the Angle between the Perpendicular and the
Object, as is demonstrated from the Difference and Sum of the
<i>Tangent</i> and <i>Secant</i> of any Arch being always equal to the
<i>Tangent</i> and <i>Cotangent</i> of the half Complement thereof to a
Quadrant. Having discovered this, I think nothing can be more
compendious, or bids fairer to compleat the Art of Gunnery, it being as
easie to shoot with a Mortar at any Object on demand, as if it were on
the Level; neither is there need of any Computation, but only simply
laying the Gun to pass, in the middle Line between the Zenith and the
Object, and giving it its due Charge. Nor is there any great need of
Instruments for this purpose: For if the Muzzle of the Mortar be turned
truly Square to the Bore of the Piece, as it usually is or ought to be,
a piece of Looking-glass Plate applied parallel to the Muzzle, will by
its Reflection give the true Position of the Piece, the Bombardeer
having no more to do, but to look perpendicularly down on the
Looking-glass, along a small Thread with a Plumbet, and to raise or
depress the Elevation of the Piece, till the Object appear reflected on
the same Point of the <i>Speculum</i>, on which the Plumbet falls; for
the Angle of Incidence and Reflection being equal, in this Case a Line
at Right Angles to the <i>Speculum</i>, as is the <i>Axis</i> of the
Chase of the Piece, will bisect the Angle between the Perpendicular and
the Object, according as our Proposition requires. So that it only
remains by good and valid Experiments to be assured of the Force of
Gunpowder, how to make and conserve it equal, and to know the Effect
thereof in each Piece; that is, how far differing Charges will cast the
same Shot out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
of it; which may most conveniently be engraven on the outside thereof,
as a standing Direction to all Gunners, who shall from thence forward
have occasion to use that Piece: And were this Matter well ascertained,
it might be worth the while to make all Mortars of the like Diameter as
near as may he, alike in length of Chase, Weight, Chamber, and all other
Circumstances.</p>

<p>This Discovery that the utmost Range on an inclined Plane, is, when
the <i>Axis</i> of the Piece makes equal Angles with the Perpendicular
and the Object; compared with what I have demonstrated of the same
Problem in the aforesaid Discourse does lead to and discover two very
ready Theorems; the one, to find the greatest Horizontal Range at 45°
Elevation, by any Shot made upon any inclined Plane, with any Elevation
of the Piece whatsoever: And the other to find the Elevations proper to
strike a given Object, with any Force greater than what suffices to
reach it with the aforesaid middle Elevation. Both which being performed
by one single Proportion, may be very serviceable to such as are
concerned in the Practice of Gunnery, but are unwilling to trouble
themselves with tedious and difficult Rules. The two Propositions are
these.</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="gesperrt">PRO</span>P.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>A Shot being made on an inclined Plane, having the Horizontal
Distance of the Object it strikes, with the Elevation of the Piece, and
the Angle at the Gun between the Object and the Perpendicular; to find
the greatest Horizontal Range of that Piece, laden with the same Charge;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
that is, half the <i>Latus rectum</i> of all the <i>Parabolæ</i> made
with the same <i>Impetus</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="gesperrt">RUL</span>E.</i></p>

<p>Take half the Distance of the Object from the <i>Nadir</i>, and take
the Difference of the given Elevation from that half; the Versed Sine of
twice that Difference subtract from the Versed Sine of the Distance of
the Object from the <i>Zenith</i>: Then shall the Difference of those
Versed Sines be to the Sine of the Distance of the Object from the
<i>Zenith</i>, as the Horizontal Distance of the Object strook, to the
greatest Horizontal Range at 45°.</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="gesperrt">PRO</span>P.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;II.</p>

<p>Having the greatest Horizontal Range of a
Gun, the Horizontal Distance and Angle of Inclination
of an Object to the Perpendicular, to
find the two Elevations necessary to strike that
Object.</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="gesperrt">RUL</span>E.</i></p>

<p>Halve the Distance of the Object from the <i>Nadir</i>; this half is
always equal to the half Sum of the two Elevations we seek. Then say,
<i>As the greatest Horizontal Range is to the Horizontal Distance of the
Object: So is the Sine of the Angle of Inclination or Distance of the
Object from the Perpendicular, to a fourth Proportional; which fourth
being subtracted from the Versed Sine of the Distance of the Object from
the <strong>Zenith</strong>, leaves the Versed Sine of the Difference of
the Elevations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
sought; which Elevations are therefore had by adding and subtracting the
half Difference to and from the aforesaid half Sum.</i></p>

<p>I shall not need to speak of the Facility of these Solutions, I shall
only observe that they are both General, without Exception or Caution,
and derived from the Knowledge that these two Elevations are equidistant
above and below the Line, bisecting the Angle between the Object and the
<i>Zenith</i>.</p>

<h3>A Discourse concerning the Measure of the Airs Resistance to Bodies
moved in it. By the Learned <strong>John Wallis</strong>, S. T. D. and
R. S. S.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THAT the Air (and the like of any other
<i>Medium</i>) doth considerably give Resistance to Bodies moved in it;
and doth thereby abate their Celerity and Force; is generally admitted.
And Experience doth attest it: For otherwise, a Cannon Bullet projected
Horizontally, should (supposing the Celerity and Force undiminished)
strike as hard against a Perpendicular Wall, erected at a great
distance, as near at hand; which we find it doth not.</p>

<p>2. But at what Rate, or in what Proportion, such Resistance is; and
(consequently, at what Rate the Celerity and Force is continually
diminished) seems not to have been so well examined. Whence it is, that
the Motion of a Project (secluding this Consideration) is commonly
reputed to describe a Parabolick Line; as arising from an Uniform or
equal Celerity in the Line of Projection, and a Celerity uniformly
accelerated in the Line of Descent; which two so compounded, do create a
Parabola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
3. In order to the Computation hereof, I first premise this
<i>Lemma</i>, (as the most rational that doth occur for my first
footing,) That (supposing other things equal) the Resistance is
proportional to the Celerity. For in a double Celerity, there is to be
removed (in the same time) twice as much Air, (which is a double
Impediment) in a treble, thrice as much; and so in other Proportions.</p>

<p>4. Suppose we then the Force impressed (and consequently the
Celerity, if there were no Resistance) as 1; the Resistance as <i>r</i>.
(which must be less than the Force, or else the Force would not prevail
over the Impediment, to create a Motion.) And therefore the effective
Force at a first Moment, is to be reputed as 1 - <i>r</i>: That is, so
much as the Force impressed, is more than the Impediment or
Resistance.</p>

<p>5. Be it as 1 - <i>r</i> to 1; so one to <i>m</i>. (which <i>m</i> is
therefore greater than 1.)</p>

<p>6. And therefore the effective Force (and consequently the Celerity)
as to a first Moment, is to be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> of
what it would be, had there been no Resistance.</p>

<p>7. This <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> is also the remaining
Force after such first Moment; and this remaining Force is (for the same
Reason) to be proportionally abated as to a second Moment; that is, we
are to take <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> thereof, that is
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub> of the impressed Force. And for
a third Moment (at equal distance of time)
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mmm</i></sub>; for a fourth
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>4</small>; and so onward
infinitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
8. Because the length dispatched (in equal times) is proportional to the
Celerities; the Lines of Motion (answering to those equal Times) are to
be as <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>2</small>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>4</small>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
of what they would have been, in the same Times, had there been no
Resistance.</p>

<p>9. This therefore is a Geometrical Progression; and (because of
<i>m</i> greater than 1) continually decreasing.</p>

<p>10. This decreasing Progression infinitely continued (determining in
the same Point of Rest, where the Motion is supposed to expire) is yet
of a finite Magnitude; and equal to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i> - 1</span></span>,
of what it would have been in so much Time, if there had been no
Resistance. As is demonstrated in my Algebra, <i>Chap.</i> 95.
<i>Prop.</i> 8. For (as I have elsewhere demonstrated) the Sum or
Aggregate of a Geometrical Progression is
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>VR - A</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span>
(supposing <i>V</i> the greatest Term, <i>A</i> the least, and <i>R</i>
the common Multiplier.) That is
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>VR</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span> -
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>A</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span>.
Now in the present Case, (supposing the Progression infinitely
continued) the least Term <i>A</i>, becomes infinitely small, or = 0. And
consequently
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>A</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span>
doth also vanish, and thereby the Aggregate becomes =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>VR</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span>. That is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
(as will appear by dividing <i>VR</i> by <i>R</i> - 1;) <i>V + <sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>R</sub> +
<sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>RR</sub> + <sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>R</sub><small>3</small> + &amp;c.</i> =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>VR</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>;
(supposing the Progression to begin at <i>V</i> = 1.) That is (dividing
all by <i>R</i>, that so the Progression may begin at
<sup><i>V</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>R</i></sub> =
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>:)
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>V</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span>
= <i><sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>R</sub> + <sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>RR</sub>
+ <sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>R</sub><small>3</small> + &amp;c.</i>,  That
is, in our present Case (because of <i>V</i> = 1, &amp; <i>R</i> = <i>m</i>:)
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small> &amp;c. =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i> - 1</span></span>.
That is, (putting <i>n</i> = <i>m</i> - 1)
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>n</i></sub> of what it would have been if
there had been no Resistance.</p>

<p>11. This infinite Progression is fitly expressed by an Ordinate in
the Exterior Hyperbola, parallel to one of the Asymptotes; and the
several Members of that, by the several Members of this, cut in
continual Proportion. As is there demonstrated at <i>Prop.</i> 15. For
let <i>SH</i>, (<i>vid.</i> Fig. 4. Tab. 5.) be an Hyperbola between the
Asymptotes <i>AB</i>, <i>AF</i>: And let the Ordinate <i>DH</i> (in the
Exterior Hyperbola, parallel to <i>AF</i>,) represent the impressed
Force undiminished; or the Line to be described in such time, by a
Celerity answerable to such undiminished Force. And let <i>BS</i> (a
like Ordinate) be <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> thereof; which
therefore, being less than <i>DH</i> (as being equal to a Part of it)
will be farther
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
than it from <i>AF</i>. In <i>AB</i> (which I put = 1) let <i>Bd</i> be
such a Part thereof, as is <i>BS</i> of <i>DH</i>. Now because (as is,
well known) all the inscribed Parallelograms, in the Exterior Hyperbola,
<i>AS</i>, <i>AH</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> are equal; and therefore their
sides reciprocal: Therefore as <i>Ad</i> = 1 -
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>
(supposing <i>Bd</i> to be taken, from <i>B</i> towards <i>A</i>,) to
<i>AB</i> = 1, or as <i>m</i> - 1 to <i>m</i>: so is <i>BS</i> =
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><i>DH</i>,
to <i>dh</i>, which is therefore equal to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i> - 1</span></span> of <i>DH</i>;
that is (as will appear by dividing 1, by <i>m</i> - 1,) to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
of <i>DH</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Or if <i>Bd</i> be taken beyond <i>B</i>; then as <i>Ad</i> = 1 +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> to <i>AB</i> = 1, or as <i>m</i>
+ 1 to <i>m</i>, so is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>
<i>DH</i> to <i>dh</i>, which is therefore equal to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i> + 1</span></span>DH;
that is (as will appear by like dividing of 1 by <i>m</i> + 1;) = to
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> -
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small> - <i>&amp;c.</i>
of <i>DH</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
12. Let such ordinate <i>dh</i>, or (equal to it in the Asymptote)
<i>AF</i>, be so divided in <i>L</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>N</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
(by Perpendiculars cutting the Hyperbola in <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>,
<i>n</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>) as that <i>FL</i>, <i>LM</i>, <i>MN</i>, be as
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
That is, so continually decreasing as that each Antecedent be to its
Consequent, as 1 to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>, or as
<i>m</i> to 1. See <i>Fig. 5. Tab. 5.</i></p>

<p>13. This is done by taking <i>AF</i>, <i>AL</i>, <i>AN</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> in such proportion. For, of continual Proportionals, the
Differences are also continually proportional, and in the same
proportion. For let <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> be such Proportionals, and their Differences <i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> That is, <i>A</i> - <i>B</i> =
<i>a</i>, <i>B</i> - <i>C</i> = <i>b</i>, <i>C</i> - <i>D</i> =
<i>c</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="subpara">Then, because A, B, C, D, <i>&amp;c.</i> are in
continual proportion,</p>

<p class="subpara">That is, A. B :: B. C :: C. D :: <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="subpara">And dividing (A - B). B :: (B - C). C :: (C - D). D ::
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="subpara">That is, <i>a</i>. B :: <i>b</i>. C :: <i>d</i>. D ::
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="subpara">And alternly <i>a. b. c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i> :: B. C.
D. <i>&amp;c.</i> :: A. B. C. <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="subpara">That is, in continual proportion as A to B, or as
<i>m</i> to 1.</p>

<p>14. This being done; the Hyperbolick Spaces <i>Fl</i>, <i>Lm</i>,
<i>Mn</i>, &amp;c. are equal. As is demonstrated by <i>Gregory
San-Vincent</i>; and as such is commonly admitted.</p>

<p>15. So that <i>Fl</i>, <i>Lm</i>, <i>Mn</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> may fitly
represent equal Times, in which are dispatched unequal Lengths,
represented by <i>FL</i>, <i>LM</i>, <i>MN</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
16. And because they are in Number infinite (though equal to a finite
Magnitude) the Duration is infinite: And consequently the impressed
Force, and Motion thence arising, never to be wholly extinguished
(without some further Impediment) but perpetually approaching to
<i>A</i>, in the Nature of Asymptotes.</p>

<p>17. The Spaces <i>Fl</i>, <i>Fm</i>, <i>Fn</i>, &amp;c. are therefore
as Logarithms (in Arithmetical Progression increasing) answering to the
Lines <i>AF</i>, <i>AL</i>, <i>AM</i>, &amp;c. or to <i>FL</i>,
<i>LM</i>, <i>MN</i>, &amp;c. in Geometrical Progression decreasing.</p>

<p>18. Because <i>FL</i>, <i>LM</i>, <i>MN</i>, &amp;c. are as
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>, &amp;c.
(infinitely) terminated at <i>A</i>; therefore (by ¶ 10) their Aggregate
<i>FA</i> or <i>dh</i>, is to <i>DH</i>, (so much Length as would have
been dispatched, in the same time, by such impressed Force undiminished)
as 1 to <i>m</i> - 1 = <i>n</i>.</p>

<p>19. If therefore we take, as 1 to <i>n</i>, so <i>AF</i>
to <i>DH</i>; this will represent the Length to be dispatched,
in the same time, by such undiminished
Force.</p>

<p>20. And if such <i>DH</i> be supposed to be divided
into equal Parts innumerable (and therefore
infinitely small;) these answer to those (as many)
Parts unequal in <i>FA</i>, or <i>hd</i>.</p>

<p>21. But, what is the Proportion of <i>r</i> to 1, or
(which depends on it) of 1 - <i>r</i> to 1, or 1 to <i>m</i>;
remains to be inquired by Experiment?</p>

<p>22. If the Progression be not infinitely continued; but end (suppose)
at <i>N</i>, and its least Term be <i>A</i> = <i>MN</i>; then, out of
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>V</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span> =
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> is to be subducted
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>A</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>R</i> - 1</span></span>
(as at ¶ 10.) that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
(as by Division will appear)
<sup><i>A</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>R</i></sub> +
<sup><i>A</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>R</i></sub><small>2</small> +
<sup><i>A</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>R</i></sub><small>3</small>
&amp;c. That is (in our present Case)
<sup><i>a</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> +
<sup><i>a</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub> +
<sup><i>a</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>
&amp;c. And so the Aggregate will be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i></span></span> +
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>mm</i></span></span> +
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>mmm</i></span></span> &amp;c. =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>.</p>

<p>And thus as to the Line of Projection, in which (secluding the
Resistance) the Motion is reputed uniform; dispatching equal Lengths in
equal Times. Consider we next the Line of Descent.</p>

<p>23. In the Descent of Heavy Bodies, it is supposed that to each
Moment of Time, there is superadded a new Impulse of Gravity to what was
before: And each of these, secluding the Consideration of the Air's
Resistance, to proceed equally (from their several beginnings) through
the succeeding Moments. As (in the erect Lines) 1 1 1 1, <i>&amp;c.</i>
1 1 1, <i>&amp;c.</i> 1 1, <i>&amp;c.</i> 1, <i>&amp;c.</i> and so
continually, as in the Line of Projection.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>24. Hence ariseth (in the transverse Lines) for the first Moment 1,
for the second 1 + 1, for the third 1 + 1 + 1, and so forth, in
Arithmetical Progression: As are the Ordinates in a Triangle, at equal
distance.</p>

<p>25. And such are the continual Increments of the Diameter, or of the
Ordinates in the exterior Parabola, answering to the interior Ordinates,
or Segments of the Tangent, equally increasing; as is known, and
commonly admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
26. If we take in the Consideration of the Air's Resistance; we are
then, for each of these equal Progressions, to substitute a decreasing
Progression Geometrical; in like manner (and for the same Reasons) as in
the Line of Projection.</p>

<p>27. Hence ariseth, for the
first Moment
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>;
for the second
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>2</small>;
for the third
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>2</small> +
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>, <i>&amp;c.</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
And such is therefore the Descent of a heavy Body falling by its own
weight. The several Impulses of Gravity being supposed equal.</p>

<p>28. That is (in the Figure of ¶ 12) as <i>FL</i>,
<i>FM</i>, <i>FN</i>, &amp;c. in the Line of Descent, answering
to <i>FL</i>, <i>LM</i>, <i>MN</i>, &amp;c. in the Line of Projection.</p>

<p>29. But though the Progressions for the Line of Projection, are like
to each of those many in the Line of Descent; it is not to be thence
inferred, that therefore <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> in the
one, is equal to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> in the other:
But in the Line of Projection (suppose)
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>&thinsp;<i>f</i> (such a Part of the Force
impressed, and a Celerity answerable:) in the Line of Descent,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>&thinsp;<i>g</i> such a Part of the
Impulse of Gravity.</p>

<p>30. Those for the Line of Descent (of the some Body) are all equal,
each to other: Because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
<i>g</i> (the new Impulse of Gravity) in each Moment is supposed to be
the same.</p>

<p>31. But what is the Proportion of <i>f</i> to <i>g</i> (that of the
Force impressed, to the Impulse of Gravity in each Body) remains to be
inquired by Experiment.</p>

<p>32. This Proportion being found as to one known Force; the same is
thence known as to any other Force (whose Proportion to this is given)
in the same uniform <i>Medium</i>.</p>

<p>33. And this being known, as to one <i>Medium</i>; the same is thence
known as to any other <i>Medium</i>, the Proportion of whose Resistance
to that of this is known.</p>

<p>34. If a heavy Body be projected downward in a perpendicular Line; it
descends therefore at the Rate
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>mm</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
of <i>f</i>, (the impressed Force) increased by
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> + <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>2</small>,
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub> + <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>2</small> + <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub><small>3</small>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> of <i>g</i> the impulse of Gravity, (by ¶ 7, and ¶ 27)
Because both Forces are here united.</p>

<p>35. If in a perpendicular Projection upwards; it ascends in the rate
of the former, abated by that of the latter. Because here the impulse of
Gravity is contrary to the Force impressed.</p>

<p>36. When therefore this latter (continually increasing) becomes equal
to that former (continually decreasing) it then ceaseth to ascend; and
doth thenceforth descend at the rate wherein the latter continually
exceeds the former.</p>

<p>37. In an Horizontal, or Oblique Projection:
If to a Tangent, whose Increments are as <i>FL</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
<i>LM</i>, <i>MN</i>, &amp;c. that is as
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>&thinsp;<i>f</i>, &amp;c. be
fitted Ordinates (at a given Angle) whose Increments are as <i>FL</i>,
<i>FM</i>, <i>FN</i>, &amp;c. that is, as
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>m</i></sub>&thinsp;<i>g</i>, &amp;c. The
Curve answering to the Compound of these Motions, is that wherein the
Project is to move.</p>

<p>38. This Curve (being hitherto without a Name) may be call'd <i>Linea
Projectorum</i>; the Line of Projects, or things projected; which
resembles a Parabola deform'd.</p>

<p>39. The Celerity and Tendency, as to each Point of this Line, is
determined by a Tangent at that Point.</p>

<p>40. And that against which it makes the greatest Stroke or
Percussion, is that which (at that Point) is at right Angles to that
Tangent.</p>

<p>41. If the Projection (at ¶ 27) be not infinitely continued, but
terminate (suppose) at <i>N</i>, so that the last Term in the first
Column or Series erect be <i>a</i>; and consequently in the second,
<i>ma</i>; in the third, <i>mma</i>, &amp;c. (each Series having one
Term fewer than that before it:) Then (for the same Reasons, as at ¶ 22)
the Aggregates of the several Columns (or erect Series) will be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>,
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>ma</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>,
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>mma</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>,
and so forth, till (the Multiple of <i>a</i> becoming = 1) the
Progression expire.</p>

<p>42. Now all the Abatements here, <i>a</i>, <i>ma</i>, <i>mma</i>,
&amp;c. are the same with the Terms of the first Column taken backward.
For <i>a</i> is the last, <i>ma</i> the next before it; and so of the
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
43. And the Aggregate of all the Numerators
is so many times 1, as is the Number of
Terms (suppose <i>t</i>,) wanting the first Column;
that is <i>t</i> -
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>, or
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nt</i> - 1 + <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>;
and this again divided by the common Denominator <i>n</i>, becomes
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nt</i> - 1 + <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>nn</i></span></span>.
And therefore
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nt</i> - 1 + <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>nn</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>g</i>,
is the Line of Descent by its own Gravity.</p>

<p>44. If therefore this be added to a projecting Force downward in a
Perpendicular; or subducted from such projecting Force upward; that is,
to or from
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>f</i>:
The Descent in the first Case will be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>f</i> +
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nt</i> - 1 + <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>nn</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>g</i>;
and the Ascent in the other Case
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>f</i> -
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nt</i> - 1 + <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>nn</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>g</i>.
And in this latter Case, when the ablative Part becomes equal to the
positive Part, the Ascent is at the highest; and thenceforth (the
ablative Part exceeding the positive) will descend.</p>

<p>45. In an Horizontal or Oblique Projection, having taken
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1-<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span></span>
&thinsp;<i>f</i>, in the Line of Projection, and thence (at the Angle given)
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nt</i> - 1 + <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>nn</i></span></span>
&thinsp;<i>g</i>, in the Line of Descent; the Point in the Curve answering to these, is
the Place of the Project answering to that Moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
46. I am aware of some Objections to be made, whether to some Points of
the Process, or to some of the Suppositions. But I saw not well how to
wave it, without making the Computation much more perplex'd. And in a
Matter so nice, and which must depend upon Physical Observations, 'twill
be hard to attain such Accuracy, as not to stand in need of some
Allowances.</p>

<p>47. Somewhat might have been farther added to direct the Experiments
suggested at ¶ 21, and 31. But that may be done at leisure, after
deliberation had, which way to attempt the Experiment.</p>

<p>48. The like is to be said of the different resistance which
different Bodies may meet with in the same <i>Medium</i>, according to
their different Gravities (extensively or intensively consider'd) and
their different Figures and Positions in Motion. Whereof we have
hitherto taken no account; but supposed them, as to all these, to be
alike and equal.</p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="gesperrt">POSTSCRIP</span>T.</i></p>

<p>49. The Computation in ¶ 41, 42, 43, may (if that be also desired) be
thus represented by Lines and Spaces. The Ablatives <i>a</i>, <i>ma</i>,
<i>mma</i>, &amp;c. (being the same with the first Column taken
backward) are fitly represented by the Segments of <i>NF</i> (beginning
at <i>N</i>) in Figure 5 and 6, and therefore by Parallelograms on these
Bases, assuming the common height of <i>Fh</i>, or <i>NQ</i>; the
Aggregate of which is <i>Nh</i>, or <i>FQ</i>. And, so many times 1, by
so many equal Spaces, on the same Bases, between the same Parallels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
terminated at the Hyperbola: The Aggregate of which is <i>hFNQn</i>.
From whence if we subduct the Aggregate of Ablatives <i>FY</i>; the
remaining Trilinear <i>hQn</i>, represents the Descent.</p>

<p>50. If to this of Gravity, be joined a projecting Force; which is to
the Impulse of Gravity as <i>hK</i> to <i>hF</i> (be it greater, less,
or equal) taken in the same Line; the same Parallels determine
proportional Parallelograms, whose Aggregate is <i>KQ</i>.</p>

<p>51. And therefore if this be a perpendicular Projection downwards;
then <i>hKkn</i> (the Sum of this with the former) represents the
Descent.</p>

<p>52. If it be a Perpendicular upwards; then the difference of these
two represents the Motion; which so long as <i>KQ</i> is the greater, is
Ascendent; but Descendent, when <i>hQn</i> becomes greater; and it is
then at the highest when they be equal.</p>

<p>53. If the Projection be not in the same Perpendicular, (but
Horizontal, or Oblique) then <i>KQ</i> represents the Tangent of the
Curve; and <i>hQn</i> the Ordinates to that Tangent, at the given
Angle.</p>

<p>54. But the Computation before given, I take to be of better use than
this Representation in Figure. Because in such Mathematical Enquiries, I
choose to separate (as much as may be) what purely concerns Proportions;
and consider it abstractly from Lines, or other Matter wherewith it is
incumbred.</p>

<p>As to the Question proposed; whether the resistance of the
<i>Medium</i> do not always take off such a proportional part of the
Force moving through it, as is the specifick Gravity of the
<i>Medium</i> to that of the Body moved in it: (For, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
so, it will save us the trouble of Observation.)</p>

<p>I think this can by no means be admitted. For there be many other
things of Consideration herein, beside the intensive Gravity (or, as
some call it, the specifick Gravity) of the <i>Medium</i>.</p>

<p>A viscous <i>Medium</i> shall more resist, than one more fluid,
though of like intensive Gravity.</p>

<p>And a sharp Arrow shall bore his way more easily through the
<i>Medium</i>, than a blunt-headed Bolt, though of equal Weight, and
like intensive Gravity.</p>

<p>And the same Pyramid with the Point, than with the Base forward.</p>

<p>And many other like Varieties, intended in my ¶ 48.</p>

<p>But this I think may be admitted, namely, That different
<i>Mediums</i>, equally liquid, (and other Circumstances alike,) do in
such proportion resist, as is their intensive Gravity. Because there is,
in such proportion, a heavier Object to be removed, by the same Force.
Which is one of the things to which ¶ 33 refers.</p>

<p>And again: The heavier Project once in Motion, (being equally swift,
and all other Circumstances alike) moves through the same <i>Medium</i>
in such proportion more strongly, as is its intensive Gravity. For now
the Force is in such proportion greater, for the removal of the same
resistance. And this Part of what my ¶ 32, insinuates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
But where there is a Complication of these Considerations one with
another, and with many other Circumstances, whereof each is severally to
be considered; there must be respect had to all of them.</p>

<h3>An Instance of the Excellence of the <strong>Modern
Algebra</strong>, in the Resolution of the Problem of finding the
<strong>Foci</strong> of Optick Glasses Universally. By <strong>E.
Halley</strong>, S. R. S.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">THE Excellence of the <i>Modern Geometry</i> is in
nothing more evident, than in those full and adequate Solutions it gives
to Problems; representing all the possible Cases at one view, and in one
general Theorem, many times comprehending whole Sciences; which deduced
at length into Propositions, and demonstrated after the manner of the
<i>Ancients</i>, might well become the Subjects of large Treatises: For
whatsoever Theorem solves the most complicated Problem of the kind, does
with a due Reduction reach all the subordinate Cases. Of this I now
design to give a notable Instance in the Doctrine of
<i>Dioptricks</i>.</p>

<p>This Dioptrick Problem is that of finding the <i>Focus</i> of any
sort of <i>Lens</i>, exposed either to converging, diverging, or
parallel Rays of Light, proceeding from, or tending to a given Point in
the <i>Axis</i> of the <i>Lens</i>, be the <i>Ratio</i> of
<i>Refraction</i> what it will, according to the Nature of the
transparent Material whereof the <i>Lens</i> is formed, and also with
allowance for the thickness of the <i>Lens</i> between the
<i>Vertices</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
of the two Spherical Segments. This Problem being solved in one Case,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, will exhibit Theorems for all the possible
Cases, whether the <i>Lens</i> be <i>Double-Convex</i> or
<i>Double-Concave</i>, <i>Plano-Convex</i>, or <i>Plano-Concave</i>, or
<i>Convexo-Concave</i>, which sort are usually call'd <i>Menisci</i>.
But this only to be understood of those Beams which are nearest to the
<i>Axis</i> of the <i>Lens</i>, so as to occasion no sensible difference
by their Inclination thereto; and the <i>Focus</i> here formed, is by
<i>Dioptrick Writers</i> commonly call'd the principal <i>Focus</i>,
being that of use in <i>Telescopes</i> and <i>Microscopes</i>.</p>

<p>Let then (in <i>Fig. 7. Tab. 5.</i>) BEβ be a double Convex
<i>Lens</i>, C the Center of the Segment EB, and K the Center of the
Segment Eβ, Bβ the thickness of the <i>Lens</i>, D a Point in the
<i>Axis</i> of the <i>Lens</i>; and it is required to find the Point F,
at which the Beams proceeding from the Point D, are collected therein,
the <i>Ratio</i> of Refraction being as <i>m</i> to <i>n</i>. Let the
distance of the Object DB = DA = <i>d</i> (the Point A being supposed
the same with B, but taken at a distance therefrom, to prevent the
coincidence of so many Lines) the <i>Radius</i> of the Segment towards
the Object CB or CA = <i>r</i>, and the <i>Radius</i> of the Segment
from the Object Kβ or K = ρ; and let Bβ the thickness of the <i>Lens</i>
be = <i>t</i>, and then let the Sine of the Angle of Incidence DAG be to
the Sine of the refracted Angle HAG or CAφ as <i>m</i> to <i>n</i>: And
in very small Angles, the Angles themselves will be in the same
proportion; whence it will follow that,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
As <i>d</i> to <i>r</i>, so the Angle at C to the Angle at D, and <i>d +
r</i> will be as the Angle of Incidence GAD; and again as <i>m</i> to
<i>n</i>, so <i>d + r</i> to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>dn + rn</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i></span></span>,
which will be as the Angle GAH = CAφ; This being taken from ACD which is
as <i>d</i>, will leave
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>m - nd - nr</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i></span></span>
analogous to the Angle AφD; and the Sides being in this Case
proportional to the Angles they subtend, it will follow, that as the
Angle AφD is to the Angle ADφ, so is the Side AD or BD to Aφ or Bφ: That
is, Bφ will be =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mdr</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m - nd - nr</i></span></span>,
which shews in what Point the Beams proceeding from D, would be
collected by means of the first Refraction; but if <i>nr</i> cannot be
subtracted from <i>m - nd</i>, it follows that the Beams after
Refraction do still pass on diverging, and the Point φ is on the same
side of the <i>Lens</i> beyond D. But if <i>nr</i> be equal to <i>m -
nd</i>, then they proceed parallel to the <i>Axis</i>, and the Point φ
is infinitely distant.</p>

<p>The Point φ being found as before, and Bφ - Bβ being given, which we
will call δ, it follows by a Process like the former, that βF, or the
focal Distance sought, is equal to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">δρ<i>n</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m</i> - δ + <i>m</i>ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>.
And in the room of δ substituting Bφ - Bβ =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mdr</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m - nd - nr</i></span></span> - <i>t</i>,
putting <i>p</i> for
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>n</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m - n</i></span></span>,
after due Reduction this following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
Equation will arise,
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mpdr</i>ρ - <i>nd</i>ρ<i>t</i> + <i>npr</i>ρ<i>t</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>mdr</i> + <i>md</i>ρ - <i>mpr</i>ρ - <i>m</i>
- <i>ndt</i> + <i>nrt</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>.
Which Theorem, however it may seem operose, is not so, considering the
great Number of <i>Data</i> that enter the Question; and that one half
of the Terms arise from our taking in the thickness of the <i>Lens</i>,
which in most Cases can produce no great Effect; however it was
necessary to consider it, to make our Rule perfect. If therefore the
<i>Lens</i> consist of <i>Glass</i>, whose Refraction is as 3 to 2
'twill be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">6<i>dr</i>ρ - 2<i>d</i>ρ<i>t</i> + 4<i>r</i>ρ<i>t</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">3<i>dr</i> + 3<i>d</i>ρ - 6<i>r</i>ρ - <i>dt</i>
+ 2<i>rt</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>.
If of <i>Water</i>, whose Refraction is as 4 to 3, the Theorem
will stand thus
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">12<i>dr</i>ρ - 3<i>d</i>ρ<i>t</i> + 9<i>r</i>ρ<i>t</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">4<i>dr</i> + 4<i>d</i>ρ - 12<i>r</i>ρ - <i>dt</i>
+ 3<i>rt</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>.
If it could be made of <i>Diamant</i>, whose Refraction is as 5 to 2, it
would be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub><i>dr</i>ρ
- 2<i>d</i>ρ<i>t</i> + <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub><i>r</i>ρ<i>t</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">5<i>dr</i> + 5<i>d</i>ρ
- <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub><i>r</i>ρ - 3<i>dt</i>
+ 2<i>rt</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>.
And this is the universal Rule for the <i>Foci</i> of double
Convex Glasses exposed to diverging Rays. But
if the thickness of the <i>Lens</i> be rejected, as not
sensible, the Rule will be much shorter, <i>viz.</i>
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pdr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dr</i> + <i>d</i>ρ - <i>prt</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>,
or in Glass
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2<i>dr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dr</i> + <i>d</i>ρ - 2<i>r</i>ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>,
all the Terms wherein <i>t</i> is found being omitted, as equal to
nothing. In this Case, if <i>d</i> be so small, as that 2<i>r</i>ρ
exceed <i>dr + d</i>ρ, then will it be - <i>f</i>, or the <i>Focus</i>
will be Negative, which shews that the Beams after both Refractions
still proceed diverging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
To bring this to the other Cases, as of converging
Beams, or of Concave Glasses, the Rule
is ever composed of the same Terms, only changing
the Signs of + and -; for the distance of
the Point of Concourse of converging Beams,
from the Point B, or the first Surface of the
<i>Lens</i>, I call a negative Distance or - <i>d</i>; and the
Radius of a Concave <i>Lens</i> I call a negative Radius,
or - <i>r</i> if it be the first Surface, and - ρ if it be
the second Surface. Let then converging Beams
fall on a double Convex of Glass, and the Theorem
will stand thus
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">- 2<i>dr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">- <i>dr - d</i>ρ - 2<i>rt</i></span></span> = + <i>f</i>,
which shews that in this Case the <i>Focus</i> is always
affirmative.</p>

<p>If the <i>Lens</i> were a <i>Meniscus</i> of Glass, exposed to
diverging Beams, the Rule is
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">- 2<i>dr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">- <i>dr + d</i>ρ + 2<i>r</i>ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>,
which is affirmative when 2<i>r</i>ρ is less than <i>dr - d</i>ρ
otherwise negative: But in the Case of converging Beams falling on the
same <i>Meniscus</i>, 'twill be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">+ 2<i>dr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">+ <i>dr - d</i>ρ + 2<i>rp</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>,
and it will be + <i>f</i>, whilst <i>d</i>ρ - <i>dr</i> is less than
2<i>r</i>ρ; but if it be greater than 2<i>r</i>ρ, it will always be
found negative or - <i>f</i>. If the <i>Lens</i> be double Concave, the
<i>Focus</i> of converging Beams is negative, where it was affirmative
in the Case of diverging Beams on a double Convex, <i>viz.</i>
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">- 2<i>dr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">+ <i>dr + d</i>ρ - 2<i>r</i>ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>,
which is affirmative only when 2<i>r</i>ρ exceeds <i>dr + d</i>ρ: But
diverging Beams passing a double Concave, have always a negative
<i>Focus</i>, <i>viz.</i>
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">- 2<i>dr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">+ <i>dr + d</i>ρ + 2<i>r</i>ρ</span></span> = - <i>f</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
The Theorems for converging Beams, are principally of use to determine
the <i>Focus</i> resulting from any sort of <i>Lens</i> placed in a
Telescope, between the <i>Focus</i> of the Object-Glass and the Glass it
self; the distance between the said <i>Focus</i> of the Object-Glass,
and the interposed <i>Lens</i> being made = - <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>I here suppose my Reader acquainted with the Rules of Analytical
Multiplication and Division, as that + multiplied by + makes the Product
+, + by - makes -, and - by - makes +; so dividing + by + makes the
Quote +, + by - makes -, and - by - makes +; which will be necessary to
be understood in the preceding Examples.</p>

<p>In case the Beams are parallel, as coming from an infinite distance,
(which is supposed in the Case of Telescopes) then will <i>d</i> be
supposed Infinite, and in the Theorem
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pd</i>ρ<i>r</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dr + d</i>ρ - <i>pr</i>ρ</span></span>
the Term <i>pr</i>ρ vanishes, as being finite, which is no part of the
other infinite Terms; and dividing the Remainder by the infinite Part
<i>d</i>, the Theorem will stand thus
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>p</i>ρ<i>r</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>r</i> + ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>,
or in Glass,
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2<i>r</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>r</i> + ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>In case the <i>Lens</i> were <i>Plano-Convex</i> exposed
to diverging Beams, instead of
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pd</i>ρ<i>r</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dr + d</i>ρ - <i>pr</i>ρ</span></span>,
<i>r</i> being infinite, it will be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pd</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>d - p</i>ρ</span></span> = <i>f</i>,
or
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2<i>d</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>d</i> - 2ρ</span></span>
if the <i>Lens</i> be Glass.</p>

<p>If the <i>Lens</i> be Double-Convex, and <i>r</i> be
equal to ρ, as being formed of Segments of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
equal Spheres, then will
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pd</i>ρ<i>r</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dr + d</i>ρ - <i>pr</i>ρ</span></span>
be reduced to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pdr</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">2<i>d - pr</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>f</i>;
and in case <i>d</i> be infinite, then it will yet be farther contracted
to ½<i>pr</i>, and <i>p</i> being =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>n</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>m - n</i></span></span>,
the focal distance in Glass will be = <i>r</i>, in Water 1½<i>r</i>, but
in Diamant ⅓<i>r</i>.</p>

<p>I am sensible that these Examples are too much for the compleat
Analyst, though I fear too little for the less Skilful; it being very
hard, if possible, in such Matters, so to write, as to give satisfaction
to both; or to please the one, and instruct the other. But this may
suffice to shew the extent of our Theorem, and how easie a Reduction
adapts any one case to all the rest.</p>

<p>Nor is this only useful to discover the <i>Focus</i> from the other
proposed <i>data</i>, but from the <i>Focus</i> given, we may thereby
determine the distance of the Object; or from the <i>Focus</i> and
Distance given, we may find of what Sphere it is requisite to take
another Segment, to make any given Segment of another Sphere cast the
Beams from the distance <i>d</i> to the <i>Focus</i> <i>f</i>. As
likewise from the <i>Lens</i>, <i>Focus</i>, and Distance given, to find
the <i>Ratio</i> of Refraction, or of <i>m</i> to <i>n</i>, requisite to
answer those <i>Data</i>. All which it is obvious, are fully determined
from the Equation we have hitherto used, <i>viz.</i> <i>pd</i>ρ<i>r</i>
= <i>drf + d</i>ρ<i>f - pr</i>ρ<i>f</i>, for to find <i>d</i> the Theorem is
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>pr</i>ρ<i>f</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>rf</i> + ρ<i>f - p</i>ρ<i>r</i></span></span> = <i>d</i>,
the distance of the Object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
For ρ the Rule is
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>drf</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>pdr + df + prf</i></span></span> = ρ.</p>
<p>But for <i>p</i> will be
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>drf + d</i>ρ<i>f</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>d</i>ρ<i>r + f</i>ρ<i>r</i></span></span> = <i>p</i>,
which latter determines the <i>Ratio</i> of Refraction, <i>m</i> being
to <i>n</i>, as 1 + <i>p</i> to <i>p</i>.</p>

<p>I shall not expatiate on these Particulars, but leave them for the
Exercise of those that are desirous to be informed in Optical Matters,
which I am bold to say are comprehended in these three Rules, as fully
as the most Inquisitive can desire them, and in all possible Cases;
regard being had to the Signs + and -, as in the former Cases of finding
the <i>Focus</i>. I shall only shew two considerable Uses of them; the
one to find the distance whereat an Object being plac'd, shall by a
given <i>Lens</i> be represented in a <i>Species</i> as large as the
Object it self, which may be of singular Use in drawing Faces and other
things in their true Magnitude, by transmitting the <i>Species</i> by a
Glass into a dark Room, which will not only give the true Figure and
Shades, but even the Colours themselves, almost as vivid as the Life. In
this Case <i>d</i> is equal to <i>f</i>, and substituting <i>d</i> for
<i>f</i> in the Equation, we shall have <i>pdr</i>ρ = <i>ddr + dd</i>ρ -
<i>dp</i>ρ<i>r</i>, and dividing all by <i>dpr</i>ρ = <i>dr + d</i>ρ -
<i>pr</i>ρ, that is,
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2<i>pr</i>ρ</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>r</i> + ρ</span></span> = <i>d</i>;
but if the two Convexities be of the same Sphere so as <i>r</i> = ρ,
then will the distance be = <i>pr</i>; that is, if the <i>Lens</i> be
Glass = 2<i>r</i>, so that if an Object be placed at the Diameter of the
Sphere distant, in this Case the <i>Focus</i> will be as far within as
the Object is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
without, and the <i>Species</i> represented thereby will be as big as
the Life; but if it were a <i>Plano-Convex</i>, the same distance will
be = 2<i>pr</i>, or in Glass to four times the <i>Radius</i> of the
Convexity; but of this Method I may entertain the Curious at some other
Time, and shew how to magnifie or diminish an Object in any proportion
assign'd, (which yet will be obvious enough from what is here deliver'd)
as likewise how to erect the Object which in this Method is represented
inverted.</p>

<p>A Second Use is to find what Convexity or Concavity is required, to
make a vastly distant Object be represented at a given <i>Focus</i>,
after the one Surface of the <i>Lens</i> is formed; which is but a
Corollary of our Theorem for finding ρ, having <i>p</i>, <i>d</i>,
<i>r</i> and <i>f</i> given; for <i>d</i> being infinite, that Rule becomes
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>rf</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>pr - f</i></span></span> = ρ,
that is in Glass
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>rf</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">2<i>r - f</i></span></span> = ρ,
whence if <i>f</i> be greater than 2<i>r</i>, ρ becomes Negative, and
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>rf</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>f</i> - 2<i>r</i></span></span>
is the <i>Radius</i> of the Concave sought.</p>

<p>Those that are wholly to begin with this Dioptrical Science, cannot
do better than to read with Attention a late Treatise of Dioptricks,
published by <i>W. Molineux</i>, Esq, R. S. S. who has at large shewn
the Nature of Optick Glasses, and the Construction and Use of
Microscopes and Telescopes; and though some nicely Critical have
endeavour'd to spy Faults, and to traduce the Book; yet having long
since examin'd it with Care, I affirm, that if I can judge, it hath but
two things that with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
any Colour may be call'd Faults; the one, an over-careful acknowledgment
of every Trifle the Author had receiv'd from others; and the other that
he labours to make easie this curious Subject, so little understood by
most, in a manner perhaps too familiar for the <i>Learned Critick</i>,
and which demonstrates that it was writ <i>cum animo docendi</i>, both
which require but very little Friendship or good Nature in the Reader,
to pass for Vertues in an Author.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 469px">

  </a>
  <div class="caption">
     <p class="title"><i>Tab. 5. pag. 359</i></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But to return to our first Theorem, which
accounting for the thickness of the <i>Lens</i>, we will
here again resume, <i>viz.</i>
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mpdr</i>ρ - <i>nd</i>ρ<i>t + npr</i>ρ<i>t</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>mdr + md</i>ρ - <i>mpr</i>ρ - <i>m
- ndt + nrt</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>And let it be required to find the <i>Focus</i> where a whole Sphere
will collect the Beams proceeding from an Object at the distance
<i>d</i>: Here <i>t</i> is equal to 2<i>r</i>, and <i>r</i> equal to ρ.
And after due Reduction, the Theorem will stand thus,
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mpdr - 2ndr + 2nprr</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">2<i>nd</i> + 2<i>nr - mpr</i></span></span> = <i>f</i>;
but if <i>d</i> be Infinite, it is contracted to
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mpr</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">2<i>n</i></span></span> - <i>r</i> =
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2<i>n - m</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">2<i>m</i> - 2<i>n</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>r</i> = <i>f</i>,
wherefore a Sphere of Glass collects the Sun-Beams at half the
Semi-diameter of the Sphere without it, and a Sphere of Water at a whole
Semi-diameter. But if the <i>Ratio</i> of Refraction <i>m</i> to
<i>n</i> be as 2 to 1, the <i>Focus</i> falls on the opposite Surface of
the Sphere; but if it be of greater Inequality it falls within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
Another Example shall be when a Hemisphere
is exposed to parallel Rays, that is, <i>d</i>
and ρ being infinite, and <i>t</i> = <i>r</i>, and after due
Reduction the Theorem results
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>nn</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>mm - mn</i></span></span>&thinsp;<i>r</i> = <i>f</i>.

That is, in Glass it is at <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub><i>r</i>, in
Water at <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub><i>r</i>; but if the Hemisphere
were Diamant, it would collect the Beams at
1<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> of the <i>Radius</i> beyond the
Center.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, As to the Effect of turning the two
sides of a <i>Lens</i> towards an Object; it is evident,
that if the thickness of the <i>Lens</i> be very small, so as
that you neglect it, or account <i>t</i> = 0; then in
all Cases the <i>Focus</i> of the same <i>Lens</i>, to whatsoever
Beams, will be the same, without any difference
upon the turning the <i>Lens</i>: But if you are
so curious as to consider the thickness, (which is
seldom worth accounting for) in the Case of parallel
Rays falling on a <i>Plano-Convex</i> of Glass,
if the plain side be towards the Object, <i>t</i> does
occasion no difference, but the focal distance
<i>f</i> = 2<i>r</i>. But when the Convex-side is towards
the Object, it is contracted to 2<i>r</i> - ⅔<i>t</i>, so that
the <i>Focus</i> is nearer by ⅔<i>t</i>. If the <i>Lens</i> be double
Convex, the difference is less; if a <i>Meniscus</i>,
greater. If the Convexity on both sides be equal,
the focal length is about ⅙<i>t</i> shorter than when
<i>t</i> = 0. In a <i>Meniscus</i> the Concave-side towards
the Object increases the focal Length,
but the Convex towards the Object diminishes
it. A General Rule for the difference arising
on turning the <i>Lens</i>, where the <i>Focus</i> is Affirmative, is this
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>2rt - 2ρt</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>3r + 3ρ - t</i></span></span>,
for double
Convexes of differing Spheres. But for <i>Menisci</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
the same difference becomes
<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>2rt + 2ρt</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>3r - 3ρ + t</i></span></span>;
of which I need give no other Demonstration, but that by a due Reduction
it will so follow from what is premised, as will the Theorems for all
sorts of Problems relating to the <i>Foci</i> of Optick-Glasses.</p>

<h3>A Discourse concerning the Action of the Sun and Moon on Animal
Bodies; and the Influence which This may have in many Diseases. By
<strong>Richard Mead</strong>, M. D. F. R. S.</h3>

<h4>PART I.</h4>

<p class="dropcap">THAT some Diseases are properly the Effects of the
Influence of the Heavenly Bodies, and that others do vary their Periods
and Symptoms according to the different Positions of one or other of
those Luminous Globes, is a very ancient and certain Observation. Upon
this score <i>Hippocrates</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
advises his Son <i>Thessalus</i> to the study of Geometry and Numbers,
because <i>the Knowledge of the Stars is of very great use in
Physick</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>.
And the earliest Histories of Epidemic Distempers, particularly do all
turn upon the alterations made in our Bodies by the Heavens.</p>

<p>But when in later Times Medicine came to be accommodated to the
Reasonings of Philosophers; no body being able to account for the manner
of this Celestial Action, It was allowed no farther share in affecting
our Health, than what might be imputed to the changes in the manifest
Constitution of the Air, excepting perhaps something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
of Truth which still remains disguised and blended with the Jargon of
Judiciary Astrology.</p>

<p>In order therefore to set this Matter in a little clearer light, I
shall in the first place shew, That the Sun and Moon regarding their
Nearness and Direction to the Earth only, besides the Effects of Heat,
Moisture, <i>&amp;c.</i> thereby caused in our Atmosphere, must at
certain times make some Alterations in all Animal Bodies; then enumerate
some Histories and Observations of such Changes, and enquire of what Use
such Thoughts as these may be in the Practice of Physick.</p>

<p>It is a constant Observation of those who write the History of the
<i>Winds</i>, That the most Windy Seasons of the Year, are the Time
about the Vernal and Autumnal Equinox; for be the Air never so calm
before or after, we never fail of having Winds at that Juncture. Every
body likewise knows, that in the most quiet Weather we are sure of some
Breeze at Mid-day and Mid-night, as also at Full Sea, <i>i.e.</i> always
about the time the Sun or Moon arrive at the Meridian. Seamen and
Country People reckon upon This, and order their Affairs accordingly.
And the changes of the Weather as to Winds or Calms especially about the
New and Full Moon, are too well known to require any Authority to
confirm such Remarks. Those who desire a fuller account of these
Observations, may see it in <i>De Chales</i>'s Navigation,
<i>Gassendus</i>'s Natural Philosophy, and <i>J. Goad</i>, his
<i>Astro-Meteoro-Logica</i>.</p>

<p>These things being Matters of Fact, and in a manner Regular and
Universal, it may very well seem strange that Philosophers have not been
more accurate in their Enquiries into the Reason of such Appearances.
True indeed it is, that the Origin of Winds is various and uncertain, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
however, so constant and uniform an Effect must undoubtedly be owing to
one necessary Cause.</p>

<p>It has bin, now a considerable time since, sufficiently made out,
that our Atmosphere is a thin Elastic Fluid, one part of which
gravitates upon another, and whose Pressure is communicated every way in
a Sphere to any given Part thereof. From hence it follows, That if by
any external Cause the Gravity of any one part shou'd be taken off or
diminished, that from all sides around this part, the more heavy Air
would rush in to restore the Equilibrium which must of necessity be
preserved in all Fluids. Now this violent running in of the heavier Air
would certainly produce a Wind, which is no more than a strong Motion of
the Air in some determined Direction. If therefore we can find any
outward Cause that would at these stated Seasons we have mentioned,
diminish the Weight or Pressure of the Atmosphere; we shall have the
genuine Reason of these Periodical Winds, and the necessary Consequences
thereof.</p>

<p>The Flux and Reflux of the Sea was a Phænomenon too visible, and too
much conducing to the Subsistance of Mankind, and all other Animals, to
be neglected by those who applyed themselves to the Study of Nature;
however all their Attempts to explain this Admirable Contrivance of
infinite Wisdom were unsuccessfull, till Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>
reveal'd to the World juster Principles, and by a truer Philosophy than
was formerly known, shew'd us how by the United or Divided Forces of the
Sun and Moon, which are encreased and lessened by several Circumstances,
all the Varieties of the Tides are to be accounted for. And since all
the Changes we have enumerated in the Atmosphere do fall out at the same times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
when those happen in the Ocean; and likewise whereas both the Waters of
the Sea and the Air of our Earth, are Fluids subject, in a great
Measure, to the same Laws of Motion; it is plain, that the Rule of our
great Philosopher takes place here, <i>viz.</i> <i>That Natural Effects
of the same kind are owing to the same Causes</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>What difference that known Property of the Air, which is not in
Water, makes in the Case, I shall shew anon; setting aside the
Consideration of that for the present; It is certain, That as the Sea
is, so must our Air, twice every 25 Hours, be rais'd upwards to a
considerable height, by the Attraction of the Moon coming to the
Meridian; so that instead of a <i>Spherical</i>, it must form it self
into a <i>Spheroidal</i>, or <i>Oval</i> Figure, whose longest Diameter
being produced, would pass thro' the Moon. That the like Raising must
follow as often as the Sun is in the Meridian of any Place, either above
or below the Horizon. Moreover, That this Elevation is <i>greatest</i>
upon the New and Full Moons, because both Sun and Moon do then conspire
in their Attraction; <i>least</i> on the Quarters, in that they then
drawing different ways, 'tis only the Difference of their Actions
produces the Effect. Lastly, That this Intumescence will be of a
<i>middle degree</i>, at the time between the Quarters, and New and Full
Moon.</p>

<p>From the same Principles, The Motion upwards of the Air will be
strongest of all about the Equinoxes; the Equinoctial Line being over
that Circle of the Globe, which has the greatest Diameter, either of the
Luminaries when in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
are nearer, and the Agitation of the Fluid Spheroid revolving about a
greater Circle, is greater; besides, the Centrifugal Force (arising from
the Diurnal Rotation) is there greatest of all. This will still be more
considerable about the New and Full Moons happening at these times, for
the Reasons just now mentioned. And the least Attraction will be about
the Quadratures of these Lunar Months, because the Declination of the
Moon from the Equator is then greatest. The different distances of the
Moon in her Perigæum and Apogæum, are the Reason that these full changes
fall out a little before the Vernal, and after the Autumnal Equinox. Now
the Inverse of all this happens when the Luminaries are in the
Solstitial Circles. Lastly, In the same Parallel, when the Moon's
Declination is towards the Elevated Pole, the Attraction is strongest
when the Moon is in that Places Meridian, and weakest when she is in the
Opposite Places Meridian: The contrary happens in the Opposite Parallel;
by reason of the Spheroidal Figure of the Earth and its Atmosphere.</p>

<p>Whatever has been said on this Head, is no more that applying what
Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i> has Demonstrated of the Sea to our Atmosphere;
and it is needless to shew how necessarily those Appearances, just now
mentioned, of <i>Winds</i>, at the Stated Times, <i>&amp;c.</i> must
happen hereupon. It will be of more use to consider the Proportion of
the Forces of the two Luminaries upon the <i>Air</i>, to that which they
have upon the Water of our Globe; that it may the more plainly appear
what Influence the Alterations hereby made, must have upon the Animal
Body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i> has demonstrated<span

class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
that the Centrifugal force raises the Water at the Equator above the
Water at the Poles, to the height of 85200 Feet. Wherefore if that Force
which is as 6031, raise the Ocean to 85200 Feet, the United forces of
the Sun and Moon, which are as 1. will raise the same to 14 Feet, for
<sup>85200</sup>&frasl;<sub>6031</sub> = 14. <i>Proximé</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
Now we know that the more easily the Waters can obey the Attraction,
with the more Force are the Tides moved; but since, as Mr. <i>Halley</i>
has determin'd it,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span>
our Atmosphere is extended to 45 Miles, whereas the middle depth of the
Ocean is but about half a Mile; it is plain, that the Air revolving in a
Sphere about 100 times larger than that of the Ocean, will have a
proportionably greater Agitation.</p>

<p>Besides, Rocks, Shelves, and the inequality of Shoars are a great
stop to the Access and Recess of the Sea: But nothing repels the rising
Air, which is also of such thinness and fluidity, that it is easily
driven, and runs every way.</p>

<p>Nor ought we to omit, that it is the universal Law of Bodies
Attracted, that the Force of Attraction is reciprocally as the Squares
of their Distances; so that the Action of the Sun and Moon will be
greater upon the Air than upon the Water, upon the Account of its
Nearness.</p>

<p>But the Consideration of the Elasticity is still of greater Moment
here, of which this is the nature, that it is reciprocally as the
Pressure, so that the incumbent Weight being diminished by the
Attraction, the Air underneath will upon this score be mightily
expanded.</p>

<p>These and such like Causes will make the Tides in the Air to be much
greater than those of the Ocean; nor is it necessary to our purpose to
determine, by nice Calculations, their particular Forces; it is
sufficient to have proved that these Motions must both be Universal, and
also return at certain Intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
Now since the raising of the Water of the Ocean 14 Feet, produces
Torrents of such a prodigious Force, we may easily conceive what
Tempests of Winds (if not otherwise check'd) the Elevation of the Air
much higher (perhaps above a Mile) will necessarily cause. And there is
no doubt to be made, but that the same infinitely Wise Being, who
contrived the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, to secure that vast Collection
of Waters from Stagnation and Corruption (which would inevitably destroy
all the Animals and Vegetables on this Globe) has ordered this Ebb and
Flood of the Air of our Atmosphere, with the like good design, that is
to preserve (in Case all other Causes should fail, as they may, and at
times do in some Countries) the sweet Freshness, and brisk Temper of
this Fluid, so necessary to Life, and keep it, by a kind of continual
Circulation, from Deadness and Stinking.</p>

<p>This Reasoning is liable to only one Objection that I know of, and
that is this: That the Appearances we have mention'd cannot be owing to
the Causes now assigned; since by Calculation from them, the Mercury
must at New and Full Moon subside in the Barometer to a certain degree,
which yet we do not observe to happen.</p>

<p>In answer to which, (besides that there have been some Observations
made of the sinking of the Mercury at those times; and it may perhaps be
the fault of the Observers that these have not been reduced to any Rule)
We are to Consider, That altho' Winds and Alterations in the Pressure of
the Atmosphere, are the necessary consequents of the Lunar Attraction,
and true Causes of the different Rise of the Mercury in the Barometer;
yet these may be produced many others ways too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
and therefore tho' regularly the Mercury would always fall at the New
and Full Moon, those other Causes may be strong enough, even to raise it
at those Seasons; in as much as two contrary Winds, for instance,
blowing towards the Place of Observation, may accumulate the Air there,
so as to increase both the height and weight of the incumbent Cylinder;
in like manner, the Direction of two Winds may be such, as meeting at
certain Angle they may keep the Gravity of the Air in the middle place
unaltered; and a Thousand such Varieties there may be, by which the
Regularity of Appearances of this nature may be hindered. Now the other
Springs, from which such Changes in the Air may arise, are these.</p>

<p>1. Elastic Vapours forc'd from the Bowels of the Earth, by
Subterraneous Heats, and condensed by whatever cause in the
Atmosphere.</p>

<p>2. A mixture of Effluvia of different qualities in the Air, may by
Rarefactions, Fermentations, <i>&amp;c.</i> produce Winds and other
Effects like those resulting from the Combination of some Chymical
Liquors; and that such things happen, we are assured from the Nature of
Thunder, Lightning, and Meteors.</p>

<p>3. From the Eruptions of Vulcanoes and Earthquakes in distant Places,
Winds may be propagated to remoter Countries.</p>

<p>4. The divided or United Forces of the other Planets and of Comets,
may variously disturb the influence of the Sun and Moon, <i>&amp;c.</i>
We know that there happen violent Tempests in the upper Regions of the
Air, while we below enjoy a Calm; and how many Ridges of Mountains there
are on our Globe, which interrupt and check the Propagation of the
Winds; so that it is no wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
that the Phænomena we have ascribed to the Action of the Sun and Moon,
are not always constant and uniform, and that every Effect does not
hereupon follow; which, were there no other Powers in Nature able to
alter the influence of this, might in a very regular and uniform manner
be expected from it.</p>

<p class="gap-above">These things being premised, it will not be
difficult to shew (as was proposed in the first Place) that these
Changes in our Atmosphere at High Water, New and Full Moon, the
Æquinoxes, <i>&amp;c.</i> must occasion some Alterations in all Animal
Bodies; and that from the following Considerations.</p>

<p>1. All living Creatures require Air of a determined Gravity to
perform Respiration easily, and with Advantage; for it is by its weight
that this Fluid insinuates it self into the Cavity of the Breast and
Lungs. Now the Gravity, as we have proved, being lessened at these
Seasons, a smaller quantity only will insinuate it self, and this must
be of smaller force to comminute the Blood, and forward its Passage into
the left Ventricle of the Heart, whence a slower Circulation insues, and
the Secretion of Spirits is diminished.</p>

<p>2. This Effect will be the more sure, in that the Elasticity of the
Atmosphere is likewise diminished. Animals want Air as heavy so Elastic
to a certain degree; For as this is by its weight forced into the Cavity
of the <i>Thorax</i> in Inspiration, so the Muscles of the
<i>Abdomen</i> press it into the <i>Bronchi</i> in Expiration, where the
bending force being somewhat taken off, and Springy Bodies when
unbended, exerting their Power every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
way, in Proportion to their Pressures, the Parts of the Air push against
all the sides of the <i>Vesiculæ</i>, and promote the Passage of the
Blood.</p>

<p>We have a convincing Instance of all this, in those who go to the top
of high Mountains, for the Air is there so pure (as they call it) that
is, wants so much of its Gravity and Elasticity, that they Breathe with
very great difficulty.</p>

<p>3. All the Fluids in Animals have in them a mixture of Elastic
<i>Aura</i>, which when set at liberty, shews its Energy, and causes
those Fermentations we observe in the Blood and Spirits: Now when the
Pressure of the Atmosphere, upon the Surface of our Body is diminished,
the inward Air in the Vessels must necessarily be inabled to exert its
Force, in Proportion to the lessening the Gravity and Elasticity of the
outward; hereupon the Juices begin to ferment, change the Union and
Cohæsion of their Parts, break their Canals, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class="gap-above">This is very plain in living Creatures put into the
Receiver, exhausted by the Air-Pump, which always swell as the Air is
more and more drawn out; their Lungs at the same time contracting
themselves, and falling so together as to be hardly discernible.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere we proceed to Matters of Fact, it may be worth the while to take
Notice, That Effects depending on such Causes as these, must of
necessity be most visible in Weak Bodies and Morbid Constitutions, when
other Circumstances concur to their taking Place. For this reason,
whatever Mischiefs do hence follow, cannot in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
least disparage the Wise Contrivance of Infinite Power in ordering these
Tides of our Atmosphere. The Author of Nature, we know, has made all
things to the greatest Advantage that could be, for the whole System of
Animals on our Globe, but it was impossible that such a disposition
shou'd not in some Cases be prejudicial to a Few. The Position and
Distance of the Sun are so adjusted, as to give in the most beneficial
manner possible, Heat and Light to the Earth; yet this notwithstanding,
some Places may be too hot for some weakly Bodies; some Autumns too
sultry to agree with some Animals, and some Winters too cold to be
endured by some tender Creatures: The whole however we must own, is most
carefully provided for. Besides, as most of these last mentioned
Inconveniencies are by easy shifts to be avoided; so there are such
Powerful Checks put to this Aereal Flux and Reflux, so many ways of
abating the Damages accruing from it now and then; that these are of no
account in comparison of the mighty Benefits hence arising, in which the
Race of Mankind does universally share.</p>

<h4>PART II.</h4>

<p>There are no Historys in Physick which we may more safely take upon
the Credit of the Authors who relate 'em, than such as we are now going
to mention. In some Cases a Point may perhaps be strained to serve a
darling Hypothesis which the Writer has taken up, but here we are much
more likely to have pure Matter of Fact, because hitherto no one has
pretended the Appearances of this kind to be within the Reach of any
Scheme of Philosophy.</p>

<p>Epileptical Diseases besides the other Difficultys with which they
are attended, have this also surprizing, that in some the Fits do
constantly return every New and Full Moon; <i>the Moon</i> (says
Galen<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>)
<i>governs the Periods of Epileptic Cases</i>. Upon this score, They who
were thus affected were called <span title="Selêniakoi">Σεληνιακοὶ</span><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
and in the Historys of the Gospel
<span title="Selêniazomenoi">Σεληνιαζόμενοι</span><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>
by some of the Latins afterwards, <i>Lunatici</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>.
<i>Bartholin</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
tells a Story of one Epileptic who had apparent Spots in her Face, which
according to the Time of the Moon, varyed both their Colour and
Magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
But no greater Consent in such Cases was perhaps ever Observed than what
I saw some time since in a Child about 5 years old, in which the
Convulsions were so strong and frequent, that life was almost despair'd
of, and by Evacuations and other Medicines very difficultly saved. The
Girl, who was of a lusty full habit of Body, continued well for a few
days, but was at Full Moon again seized with a most violent Fit, after
which, the Disease kept its Periods constant and regular with the Tides;
She lay always Speechless during the whole time of Flood, and Recovered
upon the Ebb. The Father who lives by the <i>Thames</i> side, and does
business upon the River, observed these Returns to be so punctual, that
not only coming home He knew how the Child was before he saw it, but in
the night has risen to his Employ, being warned by Cries when coming out
of her Fit, of the turning of the Water. This continued 14 days, that
is, to the next great Change of the Moon, and then a dry Scab on the
Crown of the Head, (the effect of an Epispastic Plaister, with which I
had covered the whole <i>Occiput</i> in the beginning of the Illness)
broke, and from the Sore, tho' there had been no sensible Discharge this
way for above a Fortnight, ran a considerable quantity of limpid Serum;
upon which, the Fits returning no more, I took great care to promote
this new Evacuation by proper Applications, with desired Success, for
some time; and when it ceased, besides two or three Purges with
<i>Mercurius Dulcis</i>, &amp;c. ordered an Issue in the Neck, which
being thought troublesome, was made in the Arm; the Patient however has
never since felt any Attacks of those frightful Symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
Whether or no it be thro' want of due Heed and Enquiry that we have not
in all the Collections of Histories and Cases, any Instance of the like
Nature so particular as this is, I know not; this is certain, that as
the <i>Vertigo</i> is a Disease nearly related to the <i>Epilepsy</i>,
and the <i>Hysterical Symptoms</i> do partake of the same Nature; so
both one and the other are frequently observed to obey the Lunar
Influence. In like manner, the raving Fits of Mad People, which keep
Lunar Periods, are generally in some degree Epileptic too.</p>

<p><i>Tulpius</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
and <i>Piso</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>
afford us remarkable Instances of Periodical <i>Palseys</i>.</p>

<p>Every one knows how great a share the Moon has in forwarding those
Evacuations of the weaker Sex, which have their Name from the constant
Regularity they keep in their Returns; and there is no question to be
made, but the Correspondency we here observe, would be greater still,
and even Universal, did not many Accidents, and the infinite Varieties
in particular Constitutions one way or other concur to make a
difference. It is very observable that in Countries nearest to the
Æquator, where we have proved the Lunar Action to be strongest; these
Monthly Secretions are in much greater quantity than in those near the
Poles, where this force is weakest. This <i>Hippocrates</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span>
takes notice of, and gives it as one Reason why the Women in
<i>Scythia</i> are not very fruitful.</p>

<p>The Case being thus with Females, it is no wonder
if we sometimes meet with Periodical Hæmorrhages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
answering to the times of the Moon in Males also. For as a greater
quantity of Blood in proportion to the bulk in <i>one</i> Sex, is the
reason of its discharging it self thro' proper Ducts, at certain
Intervals, when the pressure of the external Air being diminish'd, the
internal <i>Aura</i> can exert its Elasticity; so in the <i>other</i>,
if at any time there happens to be a Superabundancy of the same Fluid,
together with a weak Tone of the Fibres; it is plain that the Vessels
will be most easily burst, when the Resistance of the Atmosphere is
least. And this more especially, if any accidental hurt, or rarefying
Force has first given occasion to the other Causes to take effect.</p>

<p>I know a Gentleman of a tender frame of Body, who having once, by
over reaching, strained the parts about the Breast; fell thereupon into
a spitting of Blood, which for a Year and half constantly return'd every
New Moon, and decreasing gradually, continued always 4 or 5 days. The
Fits being more or less considerable, according as his management about
that time, contributed to a greater or lesser fullness of the
Vessels.</p>

<p>We have two notable Instances of the like nature in our Philosophical
Transactions; the one<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>
of a Person, who from his Infancy to the 24th Year of his Age, had every
full Moon an Eruption of Blood on the right side of the Nail of his left
Thumb, at first to 3 or 4 Ounces, and after his sixteenth Year, to half
a Pound each time; which when by searing the part with a hot Iron, he
stopp'd, he fell into a <i>Sputum Sanguinis</i>, and by frequent
Bleeding, <i>&amp;c.</i> was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
difficultly saved from a Consumption. The other<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>
is a Story of an <i>Inn-Keeper</i> in <i>Ireland</i>, who from the 43rd
Year of his Life, to the 55th (in which it killed him) suffered a
Periodical Evacuation at the point of the Fore-Finger of his Right-hand;
and altho the Fits here kept not their returns so certain as in the
forementioned Case, (it may be either from the irregular way of living
of the Patient, or the mighty change every Effusion made in his habit of
Body, the quantity seldom amounting to less than four Pounds at a time)
yet there is this remarkable Circumstance in the Relation, that the
first beginning of this <i>Hæmorrhage</i> was at <i>Easter</i>, that is,
the next Full Moon after the Vernal Equinox, which is one of the two
Seasons of the Year, at which we have proved the attraction of the Air,
or lessening of its Pressure, to be greater than at any other time
whatsoever.</p>

<p>But we are besides this to consider, That the Static
Chair, and nice Observation taught <i>Sanctorius</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span>
That <i>Men do increase a Pound or two in their weight every Month,
which overplus is discharged at the Months end, by a Crisis of copious,
or thick turbid Urine</i>.</p>

<p>It is not therefore at all strange that we should once a Month be
liable to the returns of such Distempers as depend upon a Fullness of
the Vessels, that these should take place at those times especially,
when the ambient Air is least able to repress the Turgency; and that
tho' New and Full Moon are both of equal Force, yet that sometimes one,
and sometimes the other only should Influence the Periods, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">{388}</a></span>
as this or that happens to fall in with the inward Repletion.</p>

<p>The Afflux of Humours to Ulcers is sometimes
manifestly altered by this Power; <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span>
<i>Baglivi</i> was acquainted with a Learned Young Man at <i>Rome</i>,
who labour'd under a <i>Fistula</i> in the <i>Abdomen</i>, penetrating
to the <i>Colon</i>, which discharged so plentifully in the Increase,
and so sparingly in the Decrease of the Moon, that he could make a very
true judgment of the Periods and Quadratures of the Planet, from the
different quantity of the <i>Matter</i> that came from Him.</p>

<p><i>Nephritic</i> Paroxysms have frequently been
observed to obey the Lunar Attraction: <i>Tulpius</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span>
relates the Case of Mr. <i>Ainsworth</i>, an <i>English</i> Minister at
<i>Amsterdam</i>, who had a Fit of the Gravel and suppression of Urine
every Full Moon, of which he found no relief till the Moon decreased,
unless by Bleeding at the Arm. After his death two large Stones were
taken out of his Bladder, and the <i>Pelvis</i> of the left Kidney was
enlarged to that degree by the quantity of Urine so often stopt there,
as to contain almost as much as the Bladder it self.</p>

<p>I was present, not long since, at the Dissection of a Child about 5
or 6 Year old, who dyed of the frequent returns of <i>Nephritic</i>
Fits, attended with Vomitings and a <i>Diarrhæa</i>. The Kidneys and
Ureters were quite stuffed with a slimy calculous Matter, and it was
very instructive to see the different degrees of Concretion in the
several parts of it, from a clear limpid Water, to a hard friable
Substance. Dr. <i>Groenvelt</i>, who had tended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">{389}</a></span>
the Boy in his Illness, observed him to be seized with his Pains at
every Full Moon for several Months together, which generally ended with
the voiding of a Stone.</p>

<p>What Influence the Moon has in <i>Asthma's</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span>
<i>van Helmont</i> takes Notice, <i>Exacerbatur Paroxysmus</i> (says he)
<i>Lunæ Stationibus, &amp; ævi tempestatibus quas ideo præsentit &amp;
præsagit</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>
And Sir <i>John Floyer</i>, who has given us a more particular History
of this Disease than any Author, observes, that <i>The Fits usually
return once in a Fortnight, and frequently happen near the Change of the
Moon</i>.</p>

<p>'Tis a more uncommon Effect of this Attractive
Power that is related by the Learned <i>Kerckringius</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>
He knew a Young Gentlewoman, whose Beauty depended upon the Lunar Force,
insomuch that at Full Moon she was Plump and very Handsome, but in the
decrease of the Planet so Wan and ill Favoured, that she was asham'd to
go abroad till the return of the New Moon gave <i>Fullness</i> to her
Face, and <i>Attraction</i> to her Charms.</p>

<p>Tho' this is indeed no more than an Influence of the same kind, with
that the Moon has always been observed to have upon Shell-Fish, and some
other living Creatures. For as the old <i>Latin</i> Poet <i>Lucilius</i>
says,<span

<p>It is very well worth the pains to enquire what share such an
Alteration in the Weight and Pressure of the Atmosphere may have in the
<i>Crises</i> or Changes of Acute Diseases. The Ancients made great
Account of <i>Critical</i> Days, and regulated their Practice according
to the Expectation they had from them; This Part of Physick is grown now
into disuse, quite slighted, and even ridiculed; and that I suppose
chiefly for these two reasons. In the first place, because the earliest
Observations of this kind, which were drawn into Rules being made in
<i>Eastern</i> Countries, when these came to be applied to the
Distempers of <i>Northern</i> Regions, without allowance given for the
difference of the Climate, they were oftentimes found not to answer. And
secondly, Fevers of old were treated with few or no Medicines, the
Motions of Nature were carefully watched, and no Violence offer'd to
interrupt her Work. The Histories therefore of <i>Crises</i>, tho' of
great Use, and certainty under such Management as this, were at length
unavoidably set aside and lost; when Acute Cases came to be Cured,
according to this or that Hypothesis, not only by Evacuations, but hot
or cold Alteratives too; there being no longer any room for those Laws
of Practice which supposed a regular and uniform Progress of the
Distemper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
Wherefore, in order to understand a little both what might Induce the
first Masters of our Profession to so nice and strict an Observance in
this point; and what grounds there may be now, for a more due regard to
their Precepts, even upon the score of the Lunar Attraction only, I
propose the following Remarks.</p>

<p>1. All Epidemic Diseases do in their regular course require a stated
time, in which they come to their height, decline, and leave the Body
free.</p>

<p>This is so constant and certain, that when a Fever of any
<i>Constitution</i> which is <i>continual</i> in one Subject, happens
from some other cause, in another to be <i>intermitting</i>, the
Paroxysms do always return so often as all together to make up just as
many days of Illness as he suffers, whose Distemper goes on from
beginning to end, without any abatement.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Sydenham</i>, a sworn Enemy to all Theories, learn'd thus much
from downright Observation; and gives this reason why Autumnal Quartans
hold six Months, because by computation the Fits of so long a time
amount to 336 hours, or 14 days, the period of a continual Fever of the
same Season.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>So <i>Galen</i> takes notice that when an Exquisite Tertian is
terminated in seven Paroxysms, a true Continual at the same time has its
Crisis in seven days; that is, the Fever lasts as long in one as in the
other, in as much (says he) as <i>a Fit in an Intermitting Feaver
answers to a day in a Continual</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span>.
Now this so comes to pass, because</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
2. In these Cases there is always a Fermentation in the Blood, which
goes not off till the active Particles are thrown out by those Organs of
Secretion, which, according to the Laws of Motion, are most fitted to
separate 'em. And</p>

<p>3. As different Liquors put upon a Ferment, are depurated in
different times, so the Arterial Fluid takes up a determined Period, of
which it is discharged of an induced Effervescence.</p>

<p>4. The Symptoms, during this Ebullition, do not proceed all along in
the same Tenour; but on some days particularly, they give such evident
Marks of their good or bad Quality, that the nature of the ensuing
<i>Solution</i> may very well be guess'd at, and foretold by 'em.</p>

<p class="gap-above">Things being thus, Those days on which the Disease
was so evidently terminated one way or other, might very justly be
call'd the days of <i>Crisis</i>; and those upon which the tendency of
Illness was discovered by most visible Tokens, the <i>Indices</i> of the
<i>Critical Days</i>.</p>

<p>And thus far the Foundation was good, but when a false Theory
happen'd unluckily to be joined to true Observations, this did a little
puzzle the Cause. <i>Hippocrates</i>, it is plain, knew not to what to
ascribe that remarkable regularity with which he saw the Periods of
Feavers were ended on the <i>Seventh</i>, <i>Fourteenth</i>, <i>One and
Twentieth</i> day, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Pythagoras</i> his Philosophy was
in those Ages very Famous, of which <i>Harmony</i> and the <i>Mysteries
of Numbers</i> made a considerable part, <i>Odd</i> were more Powerful
than <i>Even</i>, and <i>Seven</i> was the most perfect of all. Our
great Physician espoused these Notions,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span>
and confined the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
Stages of acute Distempers to a <i>Septenary</i> Progression<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span>,
upon which this Inconvenience follow'd, that when a Crisis fell out a
day sooner or later than this Computation required, his Measures were
quite broken; and that this must necessarily oftentimes happen, will
appear by and by.</p>

<p>Upon this score <i>Asclepiades</i> rejected this whole Doctrine as
vain,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span>
and <i>Celsus</i> finding it to be too nice and scrupulous, observes
that the <i>Pythagorean Numbers led the Ancients into the Error</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Galen</i> being aware of this, succeeded much better in his
reasoning upon the Matter, and very happily imputed the Critical Changes
not to the Power of Numbers, but to the Influence of the Moon; which he
observes, <i>has a mighty Action upon our Earth, exceeding the other
Planets, not in Energy, but in Nearness</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span>.
So that according to him, the Septenary Periods in Diseases are owing to
the <i>Quarterly Lunar Phases, which are the times of the greatest
Force, and which return in about seven days</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the whole Affair, in short is this, A <i>Crisis</i> is
no more than the Expulsion of the Morbific Matter out of the Body, thro'
some or other of the Secretory Organs; in order to which, it is
necessary that this should be prepar'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
and comminuted to such a degree, as is required to make it pass into the
Orifices of the respective Glands; and therefore <i>as</i> the most
<i>perfect Crisis</i> is by <i>Sweat</i>, (both by reason that the
Subcutaneous Glands do naturally discharge more than all the other put
together, and also that their Ducts being the smallest of any,
whatsoever comes this way is certainly wery well divided and broken)
<i>so</i> the most <i>imperfect</i> is an <i>Hæmorrhage</i>, because
This is an Argument that what Offends is not fit to be cast off in any
Part, and consequently breaks the Vessels by the Effervescence of the
Blood. An <i>Abscess</i> in those Organs which separate thick, slimy
Juices is of a middle nature betwixt these two.</p>

<p>Now it is very plain, That if the time, in which either the Peccant
Humour is prepar'd for Secretion, or the Fermentation of the Blood is
come to its height, falls in with those Changes in the Atmosphere which
diminish its pressure; the <i>Crisis</i> will then be more compleat and
large. And also, that this Work may be forwarded or delay'd a day, upon
the account of such an Alteration in the Air; the Distention of the
Vessels upon which it depends, being hereby made more easie, and a weak
Habit of Body in some Cases standing in need of this outward Assistance.
Thus a Fever which requires about a Week to its Period, may sometimes,
as <i>Hippocrates</i> observed, have a good Crisis on the sixth, and
sometimes not till the eighth day.</p>

<p>In Order therefore to make true Observations of this kind, the time
of Invasion is to be considered, The genuine course of the Distemper
must first be watched, which is not to be interrupted by any violent
Methods: The strength of Nature in the Patient is to be considered, and
by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
what Secretions the Crisis is most likely to be performed; and it will
then be found, that not only the <i>New</i> and <i>Full</i> Moons, but
even the <i>Southings</i>, whether visible or latent, of the Planet, are
here of considerable Moment.</p>

<p>For Confirmation of which, we need only to reflect on what Mr.
<i>Paschal</i> has remark'd, <i>concerning the Motions of Diseases and
Births and Deaths</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span>.
Dividing the <span title="Nychthêmeron">Νυχθήμερον</span> into Four
Senaries of Hours, the first consists of three hours before the Southing
of the Moon, and three after; the second of the six hours following, and
the third and fourth of the remaining Quarters of the natural day; He
takes notice that none are born, or die a natural Death in the first and
third Senaries, which he calls first and second Tides, but all either in
the second or fourth Senaries, which he calls first and second Ebbs. In
like manner, that in Agues, the tumult of the Fits generally lasts all
the Tiding time, and then goes off in kindly Sweats in the Ebbs. From
whence he very rationally concludes, that Motion, Vigour, Action,
Strength, <i>&amp;c.</i> appear most, and do best in the <i>Tiding
Senaries</i>; and that Rest, Relaxation, Decay, Dissolution,
<i>&amp;c.</i> belong to the <i>Ebbing Senaries</i>.</p>

<h4>A COROLLARY.</h4>

<p>It having bin explained in the Beginning of this Discourse, how those
Influences of the Heavens, which favour the <i>Returns</i> of
<i>Diseases</i>, may likewise raise <i>Winds</i> at the same times; and
that We feel the different Effects of <i>These</i> according as other
Causes do concurr to the Motion of the Air; it will not be amiss, to
shew in one Instance or two, how much Natural History confirms this
Reasoning.</p>

<p>There happened on the 26th of <i>November</i>, 1703. a little before
Midnight, a most terrible <i>Storm</i> of <i>Wind</i>, the Fury of it is
still fresh in every ones Mind, which lasted above six Hours.</p>

<p>It is not to the present purpose to relate its History and Causes;
What we observe is, That the Moon was at that time <i>in Perigæo</i>,
and just upon the change to <i>New</i>. Upon both which accounts its
Action in raising the Atmosphere must be great; And hence indeed the
<i>Tides</i> which followed were also very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
great, and the <i>Mercury</i> in the <i>Barometer</i>, at least, in most
places, fell very low.</p>

<p>This Influence was, without all doubt, assisted by some such other
Causes of <i>Winds</i>, as we have mentioned; These we can't know, but
may however take notice how much the manifest State of the Air
contributed to this Calamity.</p>

<p>After a greater quantity of Rains than ordinary had fallen in the
Summer and Autumn, in those places where the Storm was felt, the Winter
came on much warmer than usual; so that the Liquor in a Thermometer, of
which the 84th Degree notes Frost, never fell below the 100th.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence we may very well believe, that the Atmosphere was at that time
fill'd with Atoms of <i>Salts</i> and <i>Sulphur</i>, out of the Vapours
raised by the Heat from the moist Earth, which being variously combined
and agitated, gave that deadly force to the Motion of the Air.</p>

<p>A Proof of this we have not only from the frequent <i>Flashes</i> of
<i>Lightning</i>, observed a little before the Storm, but also from what
the Country People took notice of the next day, that the Grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
and Twiggs of the Trees, in Fields remote from the Sea, tasted very
salt, so that the Cattle wou'd not feed on them.</p>

<p>Our Histories mention another Storm, which if not equal to this last
in Violence, is however thought the greatest that had then ever been
known and memorable from the time at which it happened, <i>viz.</i> on
the 3d of <i>September</i>, 1658. the day on which the Usurper <i>O.
Cromwel</i> died.</p>

<p>No <i>Ephemerides</i> that I know of relate the Condition of the Air
that Year, but it is sufficient to remark, That whatever other Causes
concurr'd, their force was accompanied with a <i>Full Moon</i>, just
before the time of the <i>Atumnal Equinox</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the same score it comes to pass, That in those Countries which
are Subject to frequent <i>Inundations</i>, these Calamities are
observed to happen at the times of the <i>Moon</i>'s greatest Influence,
so that the Learned <i>Baccius</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span>
has rightly enough laid the Cause of such Mischiefs upon immoderate
<i>Tides of the Ocean</i>, being unhappily accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></span>
with the <i>attractive Force</i> of some or other <i>Stars</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Childrey</i> in his <i>Britannia Baconica</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span>
has from several Instances shewn the <i>Lunar</i> Action in Damages of
this kind.</p>

<p>Such and the like <i>Natural</i> Causes have <i>Storms</i> and
<i>Tempests</i>; for as to the Question of Divine Power, whether or no
Calamities of this kind do not sometimes, by the Anger of Heaven, happen
out of the Course of Nature, it is not my Business to Dispute, nor would
I by any means indeavour to absolve Mens Minds from the Bands of
Religion. For although we must allow all the Parts of the Machine of
this World to be framed and moved by Established Laws, and that the same
Disposition of its Fabrick, which is most beneficial to the Whole, must
of necessity, in some few Places now and then occasion Hurts and
Mischiefs; it is however most highly reasonable, that we should yield to
the Supreme Creator an absolute Power over all his Works; Concluding
withal, that it was perhaps agreeable to Divine Wisdom, to order the Make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
of the World after such a manner as might sometimes bring Mischiefs and
Calamities upon Mankind, whom it was necessary by the Frights of
<i>Storms</i>, <i>Thunder</i> and <i>Lightning</i> to keep in a
continual Sence of their Duty.</p>
